<h2>Sinner vs. Saint: Identity in Christ</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>It is common for Christians to say, “I am just a sinner.” At first, this sounds like humility. But when we compare it with the New Testament’s language, something feels off. Scripture consistently calls believers saints, children of God, and new creations — never sinners. This raises an important question: Should a Christian identify as a sinner, or has Christ given us a new identity that we must embrace?</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Thesis Statement</h3>
<p>A Christian’s identity is not “sinner.” In Christ, believers are called saints, new creations, and children of God. True repentance means turning away from sin and dying to the old self. Christians are not meant to continue sinning as a way of life (Rom. 6:1–2; 1 John 3:9). Yes, we stumble at times, but those stumbles do not define who we are. The truth of the gospel is this: we are saints in Christ who may occasionally stumble, not sinners who occasionally do something right.</p>
<h4>Clarification</h4>
<p>This is not a claim of perfection or sinless living. Scripture is plain: “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves” (1 John 1:8). Christians still wrestle with temptation and must confess their sins (1 John 1:9). But imperfection does not equal identity. <em>Sinner</em> describes our condition before Christ; <em>saint</em> describes our condition after Christ.</p>

<h3>Paul and John on Sin and Identity</h3>
<h4>Paul’s Teaching</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Formerly a sinner:</strong> “Though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent” (1 Tim. 1:13). The Greek adverb πρότερον (<em>proteron</em>) means “formerly, once, in the past.” It points to Paul’s old life, not his current state.</li>
  <li><strong>“Chief of sinners” clarified:</strong> In verse 15 Paul says, “of whom I am (εἰμί, <em>eimi</em>) foremost.” Though this is present tense, NT Greek often uses present verbs to express a category or rhetorical emphasis rather than strict time reference. Paul uses this as humble self-categorization, not as a doctrinal statement of his present identity. Verse 16 makes this explicit: Paul became an example of Christ’s perfect patience, not proof that he remained a sinner.</li>
  <li><strong>New identity:</strong> Elsewhere Paul never calls Christians sinners. He addresses believers as saints (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2; Eph. 1:1). He insists they are dead to sin and alive to God (Rom. 6:11), new creations (2 Cor. 5:17), and under no condemnation (Rom. 8:1).</li>
</ul>
<h4>John’s Teaching</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Acknowledges sin’s reality:</strong> “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves” (1 John 1:8). Christians still stumble, but they confess and are cleansed (1 John 1:9).</li>
  <li><strong>Not a lifestyle of sin:</strong> “No one born of God makes a practice of sinning” (1 John 3:9). The Greek phrase ποιεῖν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν (<em>poiein tēn hamartian</em>) indicates ongoing, habitual sin, not occasional failure.</li>
  <li><strong>Born sinners, reborn saints:</strong> Scripture affirms original sin — “Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity” (Ps. 51:5). All are born sinners (Rom. 3:23). But in Christ, believers are reborn as saints and children of God (1 John 3:1–2).</li>
</ul>

      <th style="text-align:left; border-bottom:1px solid #202733">Scripture</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Before Christ</td><td>Sinner by nature — born in sin, enslaved to sin, under wrath</td><td>Ps. 51:5; Rom. 3:23; Eph. 2:1–3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>At Conversion</td><td>Forgiven — washed, justified, adopted</td><td>Acts 22:16; Rom. 5:1; Gal. 4:4–7</td></tr>
    <tr><td>After Conversion</td><td>Saint / Child of God — new creation, dead to sin, alive in Christ</td><td>2 Cor. 5:17; Rom. 6:11; 1 John 3:1–2</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<hr/>
<h3>Theological & Practical Implications</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>How we speak about ourselves:</strong> Words shape identity. To call ourselves “just sinners” reinforces an identity Scripture says is dead. The New Testament never uses this label for believers but consistently calls them saints.</li>
  <li><strong>Assurance in Christ:</strong> Identifying as a sinner can erode confidence and keep believers in constant doubt. Identifying as a saint honors Christ’s finished work and strengthens assurance (Rom. 8:1).</li>
  <li><strong>Motivation for holiness:</strong> If I believe I am a sinner, sin feels inevitable. If I believe I am a saint, holiness becomes the expectation.</li>
  <li><strong>Humility rightly understood:</strong> True humility does not deny what Christ has done. It says: “I was a sinner, but Christ has made me new.” Paul models this by remembering his past while boasting in Christ’s grace (1 Tim. 1:15–16; Gal. 6:14).</li>
  <li><strong>The danger of excuses:</strong> Many Christians misuse “I’m just a sinner” as a “get out of jail free card” for lukewarm living. But Scripture never permits this (Rom. 6:15). Grace restores us when we stumble, but it never excuses sin.</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Scripture is black-and-white: all people are born sinners, condemned under sin and separated from God. But those who repent and believe in Christ are forever changed — forgiven, washed, adopted, and made saints. Paul and John both affirm that Christians may stumble, but they are no longer defined as sinners.</p>
<p>To keep calling ourselves “just sinners” is not humility. It denies the new identity Christ purchased and can become an excuse for mediocrity in holiness. The balance of Scripture is this: Christians are not perfect, but they are being perfected. They are not yet sinless, but they are no longer slaves to sin.</p>
<h4>Final Statement</h4>
<p>We must stop identifying as sinners who occasionally do something right. The gospel declares we are saints in Christ who may occasionally stumble — but our true identity is forever rooted in Him.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
  <li>πρότερον (proteron): “formerly, earlier, once” — used of past states, not present identity (cf. Gal. 4:13).</li>
  <li>Greek present εἰμί (eimi) can express a category or ongoing truth, not necessarily a current state of being; compare 1 Cor. 15:9 — “I am the least of the apostles.”</li>
  <li>ποιεῖν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν (poiein tēn hamartian) = “to practice sin” (1 John 3:9). The verb <em>poiein</em> indicates habitual practice, not isolated acts.</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h3>Personal Note</h3>
<p><strong>Sinner vs. Saint: Identity in Christ</strong></p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>It is common for Christians to say, “I am just a sinner.” At first, this sounds like humility. But when we compare it with the New Testament’s language, something feels off. This is something I've been thinking about for a long time now. How we identify ourselves — “I am just a sinner.” I understand why this is said. But it has always felt off to me. I am not trying to condemn anybody for saying it.</p>
<p>You may not agree with me, which is fine. We can even have a conversation about it and let me know why I am wrong — where, as my wife would like to say, why you disagree. We can end up just agreeing to disagree, no problem. As I said many times before everyone has a right to be wrong lol.</p>

      <p>This song carries a simple salvation message, but also a serious warning: what we watch, listen to, and consume every day shapes us. The serpent who deceived in the Garden is still at work, roaming the earth, filling hearts and minds with lies that blind people to the light of Christ.</p>
      <p>The lyrics cry out against these “voices in your head” — voices that call evil good and good as dead, voices that twist truth until confusion seems normal. Much of today’s media does this in subtle ways. It doesn’t always look evil on the surface, but it dulls our hearts and distracts us from Christ.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the song points to hope. Deep within, there is still a Voice that calls: “Come — you have a choice.” That voice is not the heart (which is deceitful), but Christ Himself, breaking the chains of demonic lies through the cross.</p>
      <p>If you’re not truly a disciple of Jesus, I urge you to consider Him. He is the way, the truth, and the life. And if you are a believer, guard your mind and soul — because the enemy is relentless in trying to drown out the still small voice of God with countless false ones.</p>

      <p><strong>Genres:</strong> Rock, Blues, Raw, Intense, Dark</p>
      <p>I wrote this song after seeing a post on Facebook that said:</p>
      <blockquote><p>“If I sinned a thousand sins today, the one thing I did do right was stay sober. Thankful for that. Let’s stay sober tomorrow.”</p></blockquote>
      <p>Now, I realize the writer was exaggerating with “a thousand sins in a day.” To do that, you’d have to sin once every 90 seconds for 24 hours straight. None of us are perfect, and yes, we stumble — but if sin still rules your life, it raises the question: have you truly repented and turned to Christ?</p>
      <p>Too many people hide behind the excuse “I’m not perfect” as a way to continue in their sin. But Scripture tells us otherwise:</p>
      <h3>Christ Our Advocate<br><small>1 John 2:1–6 (ESV)</small></h3>
      <blockquote><p>“My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. Whoever says ‘I know him’ but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this we may know that we are in him: whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.”</p></blockquote>
      <h3>Washed, Yet Feet Need Washing<br><small>John 13:7–10 (ESV)</small></h3>
      <blockquote><p>Jesus answered him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.” Peter said to him, “You shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.” Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” Jesus said to him, “The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you.”</p></blockquote>
      <p>Addictions and struggles are real, and we must be diligent to guard against them. But when we come to Christ, we don’t give Him just one part of our life — we surrender everything. Our whole life belongs to Him. And when we fully surrender, even the hardest battles grow lighter, because His grace strengthens us to press on.</p>
      <p>That’s the heart of this song: repentance, surrender, and the bold declaration — no looking back.</p>
