<p>This song carries a simple salvation message, but also a serious warning: what we watch, listen to, and consume every day shapes us. The serpent who deceived in the Garden is still at work, roaming the earth, filling hearts and minds with lies that blind people to the light of Christ.</p>
<p>The lyrics cry out against these “voices in your head” — voices that call evil good and good as dead, voices that twist truth until confusion seems normal. Much of today’s media does this in subtle ways. It doesn’t always look evil on the surface, but it dulls our hearts and distracts us from Christ.</p>
<p>At the same time, the song points to hope. Deep within, there is still a Voice that calls: “Come — you have a choice.” That voice is not the heart (which is deceitful), but Christ Himself, breaking the chains of demonic lies through the cross.</p>
<p>If you’re not truly a disciple of Jesus, I urge you to consider Him. He is the way, the truth, and the life. And if you are a believer, guard your mind and soul — because the enemy is relentless in trying to drown out the still small voice of God with countless false ones.</p>
