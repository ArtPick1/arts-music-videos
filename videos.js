    description: "Sinner vs. Saint: Identity in Christ\n\nIntroduction\nIt is common for Christians to say, “I am just a sinner.” At first, this sounds like humility. But when we compare it with the New Testament’s language, something feels off. Scripture consistently calls believers saints, children of God, and new creations — never sinners. This raises an important question: Should a Christian identify as a sinner, or has Christ given us a new identity that we must embrace?\n________________________________________\nThesis Statement\nA Christian’s identity is not “sinner.” In Christ, believers are called saints, new creations, and children of God. True repentance means turning away from sin and dying to the old self. Christians are not meant to continue sinning as a way of life (Rom. 6:1–2; 1 John 3:9). Yes, we stumble at times, but those stumbles do not define who we are. The truth of the gospel is this: we are saints in Christ who may occasionally stumble, not sinners who occasionally do something right.\nClarification \nThis is not a claim of perfection or sinless living. Scripture is plain: “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves” (1 John 1:8). Christians still wrestle with temptation and must confess their sins (1 John 1:9). But imperfection does not equal identity. Sinner describes our condition before Christ; saint describes our condition after Christ.\n________________________________________\nSinner vs. Saint — Identity Traits\nSinner (Before Christ)\tSaint (In Christ)\nDefined by sin (Eph. 2:1–3)\tDefined by grace (Eph. 2:4–6)\nSlave to sin (Rom. 6:6, 20)\tSlave to righteousness (Rom. 6:18)\nOld self/nature (Col. 3:9)\tNew creation (2 Cor. 5:17)\nUnder condemnation (Rom. 8:1, outside Christ)\tNo condemnation in Christ (Rom. 8:1)\nSeparated from God (Isa. 59:2)\tReconciled to God (Rom. 5:10)\nDead in trespasses (Eph. 2:1)\tAlive in Christ (Rom. 6:11)\nEnemy of God (Rom. 5:10)\tChild of God (1 John 3:1–2)\nHabitual practice of sin (1 John 3:8)\tCalled to holiness (1 Pet. 1:15–16)\n________________________________________\nPaul and John on Sin and Identity\nPaul’s Teaching\nPaul is often cited as calling himself the “chief of sinners” (1 Tim. 1:15). But careful reading shows he was magnifying grace, not describing his present identity.\n•\tFormerly a sinner: “Though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent” (1 Tim. 1:13). The Greek adverb πρότερον (proteron) means “formerly, once, in the past.” It points to Paul’s old life, not his current state.¹\n•\t“Chief of sinners” clarified: In verse 15 Paul says, “of whom I am (εἰμί, eimi) foremost.” Though this is present tense, NT Greek often uses present verbs to express a category or rhetorical emphasis rather than strict time reference.² Paul uses this as humble self-categorization, not as a doctrinal statement of his present identity. Verse 16 makes this explicit: Paul became an example of Christ’s perfect patience, not proof that he remained a sinner.\n•\tNew identity: Elsewhere Paul never calls Christians sinners. He addresses believers as saints (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2; Eph. 1:1). He insists they are dead to sin and alive to God (Rom. 6:11), new creations (2 Cor. 5:17), and under no condemnation (Rom. 8:1).\nJohn’s Teaching\nJohn strikes a careful balance between honesty about sin and clarity about identity.\n•\tAcknowledges sin’s reality: “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves” (1 John 1:8). Christians still stumble, but they confess and are cleansed (1 John 1:9).\n•\tNot a lifestyle of sin: “No one born of God makes a practice of sinning” (1 John 3:9). The Greek phrase ποιεῖν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν (poiein tēn hamartian) indicates ongoing, habitual sin, not occasional failure.³\n•\tBorn sinners, reborn saints: Scripture affirms original sin — “Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity” (Ps. 51:5). All are born sinners (Rom. 3:23). But in Christ, believers are reborn as saints and children of God (1 John 3:1–2).\n________________________________________\nTimeline of Identity\nStage\tIdentity\tScripture\nBefore Christ\tSinner by nature — born in sin, enslaved to sin, under wrath\tPs. 51:5; Rom. 3:23; Eph. 2:1–3\nAt Conversion\tForgiven — washed, justified, adopted\tActs 22:16; Rom. 5:1; Gal. 4:4–7\nAfter Conversion\tSaint / Child of God — new creation, dead to sin, alive in Christ\t2 Cor. 5:17; Rom. 6:11; 1 John 3:1–2\n________________________________________\nTheological & Practical Implications\n1.\tHow we speak about ourselves\nWords shape identity. To call ourselves “just sinners” reinforces an identity Scripture says is dead. The New Testament never uses this label for believers but consistently calls them saints.\n2.\tAssurance in Christ\nIdentifying as a sinner can erode confidence and keep believers in constant doubt. Identifying as a saint honors Christ’s finished work and strengthens assurance (Rom. 8:1).\n3.\tMotivation for holiness\nIf I believe I am a sinner, sin feels inevitable. If I believe I am a saint, holiness becomes the expectation.\n4.\tHumility rightly understood\nTrue humility does not deny what Christ has done. It says: “I was a sinner, but Christ has made me new.” Paul models this by remembering his past while boasting in Christ’s grace (1 Tim. 1:15–16; Gal. 6:14).\n5.\tThe danger of excuses\nMany Christians misuse “I’m just a sinner” as a “get out of jail free card” for lukewarm living. But Scripture never permits this (Rom. 6:15). Grace restores us when we stumble, but it never excuses sin.\n________________________________________\nConclusion\nScripture is black-and-white: all people are born sinners, condemned under sin and separated from God. But those who repent and believe in Christ are forever changed — forgiven, washed, adopted, and made saints. Paul and John both affirm that Christians may stumble, but they are no longer defined as sinners.\nTo keep calling ourselves “just sinners” is not humility. It denies the new identity Christ purchased and can become an excuse for mediocrity in holiness. The balance of Scripture is this: Christians are not perfect, but they are being perfected. They are not yet sinless, but they are no longer slaves to sin.\nFinal Statement\nWe must stop identifying as sinners who occasionally do something right.\nThe gospel declares we are saints in Christ who may occasionally stumble — but our true identity is forever rooted in Him.\n________________________________________\nNotes\n1.\tπρότερον (proteron): “formerly, earlier, once” — used of past states, not present identity (cf. Gal. 4:13).\n2.\tGreek present εἰμί (eimi) can express a category or ongoing truth, not necessarily a current state of being; compare 1 Cor. 15:9 — “I am the least of the apostles.”\n3.\tποιεῖν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν (poiein tēn hamartian) = “to practice sin” (1 John 3:9). The verb poiein indicates habitual practice, not isolated acts.\n\nSinner vs. Saint: Identity in Christ \nIntroduction\nIt is common for Christians to say, “I am just a sinner.” At first, this sounds like humility. But when we compare it with the New Testament’s language, something feels off. \nThis is something I've been thinking about for a long time now\nHow we identify ourselves “I am just a sinner.”  I understand why this is said. \nBut it has always felt off to me. I am not trying to condemn anybody for saying it.\nYou may not agree with me which is fine We can even have a conversation about it and let me know why I am wrong Where is my wife would like to say why you disagree. \nWe can end up just agreeing to disagree, no problem. \nAs I said many times before everyone has a right to be wrong lol.\n\nAdditional Note:\nThis song — or the statement — does not mean I believe in “once saved, always saved.” I do believe it is possible for us to willfully fall away and become shipwrecked. But this does not happen simply when you stumble or fall, as long as you repent, turn away, and keep following Christ. One thing I once heard from a pastor at the church I used to attend is that salvation is like Tupperware — you have to try very hard to destroy it, and that’s not easy. I may not have agreed with him on other things, but on that point I did agree."
