    title: `Yirat Ometz – Song of Reverent Boldness`,
    videoUrl: `https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z7Jxiz39zQA`,
    description: `🔥 Yirat-Ometz — Hebrew for “Reverent Boldness” — is a cry for a generation to rise in holy fear and Spirit-empowered courage. 

Inspired by Malachi 2:4–5 and Malachi 1:8, this song confronts a sobering truth:

The modern Church has lost its fear and dread of God.  
We’ve lost reverence… and we’ve lost our fire.

We offer up polluted worship.  
We withhold our best, our all.  
We lay part of ourselves on the altar — but not everything.

“When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that not evil? … Present that to your governor; will he accept you or show you favor?” – Malachi 1:8

We talk of grace, but forget God’s holiness.  
We speak of love, but neglect surrender.  
This isn’t about louder music or better performances — it’s about laying our lives down in trembling obedience.

“My covenant was with him, a covenant of life and peace… a covenant of fear, and he feared Me. He stood in awe of My name.” – Malachi 2:5

This is not pride shouting — it’s humility burning.  
🔥 This is Yirat-Ometz — reverent boldness.`

    description: `Faith Unchained is a gritty rock/metal anthem inspired by Philippians 1:12–14 and Matthew 28:18–20.  
Paul’s imprisonment became a platform for the Gospel — and we’re called to live the same way: bold, unashamed, unchained.  
This song is a wake-up call to believers in a culture of fear and complacency. The Church is not called to sit silent or just bring people to a preacher — we are commissioned to GO, to proclaim Christ, to live unbound by fear.

Philippians 1:12–14  
Matthew 28:18–20`

    videoUrl: `https://www.youtube.com/embed/buws9YQyytU`,
    description: `Come and Grow (Rap) hits hard with raw bars, heavy beats, and a straight-up call to truth.  
This track isn’t about hype — it’s about hope. It’s for the ones who’ve been burned, scarred, and left behind by fake religion or empty promises.

Every verse spits the reality that Jesus still calls, His Word still heals, and His love still holds.  
It’s gritty. It’s real. It’s an open door to step into the light and grow in Christ.

If you’ve been searching for something real — Come to Christ.

Scriptures behind the song:  
John 8:32 – “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”  
Hebrews 10:25 – “Do not neglect to meet together…”  
2 Corinthians 6:7 – “In truthful speech and in the power of God…”`

    title: `Nothing Held Back`,
    videoUrl: `https://www.youtube.com/embed/be5UgHGGa4g`,
    description: `"Nothing Held Back" is a raw, unapologetic rock/metal anthem calling believers to full surrender to Christ. Inspired by passages like Malachi 1, Acts 5, and Psalm 51, it challenges the halfhearted offerings we bring before the King of kings and calls us to lay everything at His feet.

With gritty guitar riffs, heavy drums, and haunting breakdowns, this song confronts the danger of holding back — whether in worship, obedience, or sacrifice. It's a cry for holiness, repentance, and letting Christ reign over every part of our lives.`

    description: `This version of "Come and Grow" features pencil-drawn visuals and a blues/R&B groove that adds depth to the church invitation message. It’s for those who’ve been hurt by religion but are still hungry for something real.

Blending gospel tones and honest lyrics, it paints a picture of restoration — calling people to healing, discipleship, and growth in Christ in the context of real community.`
