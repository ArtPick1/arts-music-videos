<p><em>“And Still I Disobeyed”</em> is a confessional blues lament about knowing God’s will, knowing the cost, and still choosing the wrong way.</p>

<p>It wrestles honestly with weakness of the flesh, recurring temptation, and the need to die to self and live in Christ.</p>

<p>This song is not performance worship.<br/>
It is a plea.<br/>
A prayer spoken from failure.</p>

<p>The closing Scripture reminds us that hope is Christ living in us:</p>
<blockquote>“I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me…”<br/>

<h3>Lyrics — “And Still I Disobeyed”</h3>

<pre style="white-space:pre-wrap; font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', monospace;">
[Verse 1]
I know Your voice
I know Your ways
I know the cost
And still I disobeyed

[Verse 2]
God, what has brought me to this place?
Why do I wrestle with this temptation today?
How do I stand when the urge is so great?

My flesh is weak
I want to give in
My flesh is weak

[Chorus]
I know Your voice
I know Your ways
I know the cost
And still I disobeyed

[Verse 3]
Lord, I thought I had this under control
I thought I had it buried, laid it low
But it has raised its ugly head again
And now I’m face to face with this old sin

[Bridge]
God, You must be my refuge
I must run home to You
Crucify this flesh in me
Turn my desires only to You

[Outro]
I am weak, but You are strong
Not my will
Not my way
Put this old man in the grave

    message: `<h2>Jonah’s Prayer (A Blues Lament from the Depths)</h2>

<p><em>“Jonah’s Prayer”</em> is a slow, minor-key blues lament inspired by Jonah 2 — a cry from the depths of affliction, rebellion, repentance, and deliverance.</p>

<p>This song follows the emotional arc of the prayer itself: <strong>desperate → repentant → grateful → resolved</strong>.</p>

<p>With baritone grit, restrained spoken word, and a deep blues pocket, the song reflects on what it feels like to turn away from God — not being swallowed by a great fish, but feeling the crushing weight of separation from Him. Yet even in the depths, the prayer is heard.</p>

<p>This is not performance worship.<br/>
It is confession.<br/>
It is remembrance.<br/>
It is thanksgiving.</p>

<p><strong>“Salvation is of the Lord.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>📜 Scripture Inspiration:</strong> Jonah 2:1–9 (Psalm-style lament and thanksgiving)</p>

<h3>Lyrics — “Jonah’s Prayer”</h3>

<pre style="white-space:pre-wrap; font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', monospace;">
Intro (Spoken)
We may not be swallowed by a great fish like Jonah…
When we turn away from God.
But our corrupted souls drift far from Him.
And the weight of that separation
Presses down
Until we’re drowning.

Verse 1
I cried by reason of my affliction unto the Lord
(I cried by reason of my affliction unto the Lord)
Out of the belly of hell I cried
And You heard my voice
(Yes Lord, You heard my voice)

Verse 2
You cast me into the deep, in the midst of the sea
You cast me into the deep, Lord, in the midst of the sea
The floods surrounded me
All Your waves and billows passed over me

Chorus
I said, I am cast out of Your sight
I said, I am cast out of Your sight
Yet I will look again
I will look again toward Your holy temple

Verse 3
The waters compassed me, even down into my soul
The waters compassed me, even down into my soul
The depth closed around me
The weeds were wrapped about my head

Verse 4
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains
I went down where the earth with her bars closed me in
Yet You brought my life up from corruption
O Lord my God, You brought me up again

Chorus
I said, I am cast out of Your sight
I said, I am cast out of Your sight
Yet I will look again
I will look again toward Your holy temple

Bridge
When my soul fainted within me
I remembered the Lord
And my prayer came into Your holy temple

Verse 5
They that observe lying vanities
They forsake their own mercy
But I will sacrifice with thanksgiving
I will pay that which I have vowed

Outro
Salvation is of the Lord
Salvation is of the Lord
Salvation is of the Lord

<p><em>“Silent Night, Holy Night”</em> is one of the most beloved traditional Christmas hymns ever written.</p>
<p>The lyrics were written in 1816 by Joseph Mohr, and the melody was composed in 1818 by Franz Xaver Gruber.</p>
<p>The hymn was first performed on Christmas Eve, 1818, in Oberndorf, Austria, accompanied by a simple acoustic guitar — a humble beginning that shaped the song’s quiet, intimate character.</p>

  <li>Acoustic folk hymn style</li>
  <li>Slow, reverent tempo</li>
  <li>Male lead with congregational voices</li>

<p>This is a rewritten version of my original <em>“You Alone Are Worthy”</em> blues worship song.</p>
<p>The original version came from a raw, blues-driven place — personal worship, expressive, and reflective.</p>
<p>As I sat with it, I realized the heart of the song was something that could be shared and sung with others, and that it needed to be simpler.</p>
<p>So this version strips everything back:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One acoustic guitar</li>
  <li>A simple melody</li>
  <li>Clear, repeatable lines</li>
  <li>A slower pace that leaves room to breathe</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t performance worship.</p>
<p>It’s prayer.</p>
<p>It’s surrender.</p>
<p>It’s a song meant to be sung.</p>
<p>My hope is that this version makes it easier for quiet moments of worship to lift your voice simply and honestly:</p>
<p><strong>You alone are worthy.</strong></p>`

<h3>Lyrics</h3>

<p><strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br/>
Lord, here I am, humbled in Your presence<br/>
I place my life into Your hands<br/>
Mold me, shape me<br/>
Do with me as You will<br/>
There are no words for Your holiness<br/>
No measure for Your power<br/>
Shape me into who You’ve called me to be<br/>
Guide me hour by hour</p>

<p><strong>[Chorus]</strong><br/>
You alone, You alone are worthy<br/>
(You alone are worthy)<br/>
What more can I say?<br/>
(Lord, what can I say?)<br/>
Let my life be praise and honor<br/>
All of my days<br/>
You alone, You alone are worthy<br/>
Teach me Your holy ways<br/>
Let my life reflect Your glory<br/>
All of my days</p>

<p><strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br/>
I want to follow only Your will<br/>
I want to hear Your still small voice<br/>
Lead me where You call me to walk<br/>
Let obedience be my choice<br/>
Guide my steps and create in me a new heart<br/>
Keep me walking in Your way<br/>
Let my life bring honor to You<br/>
Every step, every day</p>

<p><strong>[Bridge]</strong><br/>
No matter what they think<br/>
No matter what they say<br/>
My life belongs to You alone<br/>
When I speak, let it be with fear of You<br/>
When I walk, let it be in Your light</p>

<p><strong>[Final Chorus]</strong><br/>
You alone, You alone are worthy<br/>
Let me be Your light<br/>
In this darkened land<br/>
You alone, You alone are worthy</p>`

<p>This song was recorded as a raw blues jam — unpolished, unforced, and honest.</p>
<p>This song comes straight from my heart.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget our true calling. A building is not the Church. What it looks like doesn’t matter. Whether it “looks like a church” doesn’t matter. What matters is obedience.</p>
<p>We are called to go out and spread the gospel. Yet we can barely get people to do the simplest things — for example, liking or sharing the pastor’s sermons on social media.</p>
<p>We struggle to get believers to hand out a tract at a restaurant or even leave one on the table.</p>
<p>If we won’t do that, how do we expect to reach the lost?</p>
<p>And that’s not even touching real evangelism — one-on-one conversations, praying with a waitress or waiter before a meal, opening our mouths and speaking the name of Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>That’s where the rubber meets the road.</strong></p>
<p>Put on headphones or play it loud. Let the song do what it’s meant to do.</p>`

<p>Silent Night Holy Night — Blues Edition This video tells the full story of how Silent Night came to be — not the version most people know. Through a series of cinematic images, you’ll see the legendary tale unfold: a mouse breaking the church organ… a preacher seeking help on a winter night… two men creating a new song with only a guitar… and how that simple melody spread beyond one small village.</p>
<p>The final scenes show how this song traveled through time — even reaching the trenches of World War I, where opposing soldiers called a Christmas truce and sang Stille Nacht together in the snow. This is Silent Night re-imagined with a blues-gospel edge, inspired by the original 1818 German lyrics and translated into English. A story of peace, purpose, and the power of a song that changed the world. If this blessed you, please like, comment, and share. Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>⭐ A Story Worth Telling: From a Quiet Village to the Trenches of War</strong><br>
There’s a famous old legend that Silent Night first came to life because a mouse chewed through the church organ bellows on Christmas Eve in 1818. Historians will tell you there’s no proof the mouse story is true… and no proof it’s false. It lives in that sacred place where folklore and faith sit side by side. As Gandalf said in The Lord of the Rings: “Every good story deserves a little embellishment.” And Silent Night is one of those stories.</p>
<p><strong>⭐ A Quiet Beginning (1818)</strong><br>
In the little Austrian village of Oberndorf, a young priest named Joseph Mohr walked through the snow to visit his friend, Franz Gruber, the church organist. In his hand was a poem he had written two years earlier — Stille Nacht. He didn’t ask for an organ arrangement. He asked for something simple. Something humble. Something a small congregation could sing on a silent winter night. Gruber picked up his guitar and wrote the melody in one sitting.</p>
<p>That evening, the two men stood in the candlelit church, one singing tenor, one singing bass, guitar in hand, and they sang the song for the very first time. No spotlight. No orchestra. Just two voices… and a Savior born in the dark. The mouse might not have been real. But the quiet beauty of that night was.</p>
<p><strong>⭐ A Song That Wouldn’t Stay Small</strong><br>
A traveling organ builder named Karl Mauracher later visited the church for repairs. He heard the song, loved it, and carried a copy back to the Tyrol region. From there, singing families began performing it publicly. And soon Silent Night spread everywhere — across Europe, across oceans, across generations.</p>
<p><strong>⭐ The Night War Stopped Singing (1914)</strong><br>
On Christmas Eve in 1914, British soldiers huddled in freezing trenches heard German troops singing Stille Nacht. They responded with Silent Night in English. Voices rose from both trenches… and then soldiers climbed out, shook hands, exchanged food, traded cigarettes, and paused the war long enough to sing together: “Sleep in heavenly peace.”</p>
<p><strong>⭐ From a Mouse Myth to a Miracle Moment</strong><br>
Maybe a mouse didn’t chew through the organ in 1818. But the miracle is this: a simple song written for guitar in a tiny village traveled across Europe… and one night stopped a war long enough for enemies to sing together.</p>
<p><strong>⭐ My Version: Silent Night Holy Night Blues</strong><br>
That’s why I used the direct English translation of all six original German verses — not the later hymn version — and set it in a Blues–Gospel style with male vocals and soulful female harmony. Because this isn’t just a Christmas song. It’s a reminder that peace can break into the darkest places — in a small church, in a world at war, and maybe in our own lives too.</p>`

    message: `<h2>A Time to Speak</h2>
<p><em>“A Time to Speak”</em> is a rock/metal prayer built straight from Scripture — the struggle between silence, obedience, boldness, and surrender. Drawn from <strong>Ecclesiastes 3:7</strong> (“a time to keep silence, and a time to speak”), this song wrestles with the fire inside — the burden to warn, to plead, to shake people awake — and the truth that only the Holy Spirit can open ears and change hearts (<strong>John 16:8</strong>; <strong>Zechariah 4:6</strong>).</p>
<p>The lyrics reflect passages like <strong>Jeremiah 20:9</strong> (“His word was in my heart like a fire… I could not hold it in”), <strong>Ezekiel 3:18–21</strong> (the responsibility to speak when God commands), <strong>Proverbs 17:27–28</strong> (the wisdom of restraint), <strong>James 1:19</strong> (“slow to speak”), <strong>Isaiah 50:4</strong> (“the tongue of the learned” to speak at the right moment), and <strong>Acts 4:29–31</strong> (boldness given by the Spirit, not human force).</p>
<p>The video’s storm-filled sky and piercing light symbolize that tension: waiting, listening, speaking only when God commands, and trusting His Spirit to do what no amount of shouting can do.</p>
<p>This reflects a lot of my own struggles — learning not to repeat myself or beat people over the head because I feel like they’re not listening. Learning to say it once, say it clearly (or as clearly as I can), and then let the Holy Spirit take it and do with it as God sees fit. It doesn’t mean that if they want to talk about something, I can’t keep talking — but when I realize they’re not listening, I need to shut up. I’ve planted the seed. That’s all I can do. I can’t beat them over the head. I can’t shake them and make them see.</p>
<p>The last couple of weeks have been a test for me — listening for that still, small voice and saying what I need to say, or not saying something and letting the Holy Spirit put the words on my lips that I need to say. But at the same time, I often feel like Moses — I stutter, and no one would really want to listen to me or care what I have to say. Yet God still calls and still uses weak, stumbling voices.</p>
<p><strong>All glory to Jesus Christ alone.</strong></p>`

    message: `<h2>Christmas at Denny’s</h2>
<p>This song tells a fictional late-night diner story — a blues-style illustration of what it looks like when the Gospel steps into the quiet corners of life. It’s not a real event, but it paints a picture many of us recognize: a weary soul, an empty booth, and a moment where grace breaks through the dark. Inspired by the mood of Randy Stonehill’s Christmas at Denny’s, this song builds its own imagined scene — a reminder of how easily we overlook the people who sit right in front of us, especially during the holidays. This story isn’t something that happened… It’s something that could happen — and something that should remind us how to live. Let this fictional scene push you to look around, slow down, and reach out. Because even made-up stories can reveal real truth about what it means to follow Christ.</p>`

    message: `<h2>Holy Spirit – Awaken the Fire</h2>
<p><em>“Holy Spirit – Awaken the Fire”</em> is a dark acoustic-blues cry for boldness. A prayer from the shadows — for courage, conviction, and the fire of God to rise again.</p>
<p>This isn’t about thrills, goosebumps, or emotional hype. It’s about the Holy Spirit empowering obedience, truth, courage, and a witness that stands firm where others shrink back.</p>
<p>Filmed with gritty, low-light blues imagery — alleyways, embers, shadows, and a lone voice in the dark — this video follows the lyrical journey of calling on the Spirit to ignite boldness again.</p>
<p><strong>No polish. No performance. Just a raw prayer:</strong><br/>
<strong>“Holy Spirit, awaken the fire in me.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>All glory to Jesus Christ alone.</strong></p>`

<p>The reason I wrote it began last night after church. On the way home, Cindy asked me what I was feeling about our church. That’s a deep subject for me because of our previous church.</p>
<p>Later that night, while I was working on something else, I kept sensing that I needed to write down what was stirring in my heart and soul.</p>
<p>This song is what came out of that moment — a simple prayer of surrender: <em>“Lead me, Lord… wherever You want me to go.”</em></p>
<p>Lead Me, Lord — a male–female duet built from a simple, honest prayer. A cry for direction, faithfulness, and steady obedience:<br/>
“Help me follow You wherever You lead…<br/>
Keep my heart steady in praise…<br/>
Help me stand firm in Your Word all my days.”</p>
<p>If you’re seeking clarity, surrender, or need to draw near to Christ again — this song is for you.</p>`

  message: `<h2>Not Just Lip Service</h2>
<p><em>“Not Just Lip Service”</em> is a gritty acoustic-blues call to repentance — a cry for revival that starts within. Set in an old urban church at dawn, the song strips away performance and pretension, reminding us that worship without obedience is empty. The harmonica becomes a prayer between verses — the sound of conviction turning to surrender. This song asks the Church to do more than sing for fire from above — to walk the walk, to lay down idols, and to become the altar flame. When our hearts are truly undone, the Spirit can finally heal.</p>

    message: `<h2>Lonesome Valley (You Don’t Walk Alone)</h2>
  <p><strong>Context / Why I rewrote it:</strong> As I was searching YouTube for harmonica lessons, I ran across this song and listened to it. Immediately I realized how wrong theologically it was. I understood what they were trying to say, but it just wasn’t right — so I had to rewrite it.</p>

  <h3>About the Original</h3>
  <p>The earliest known version of “You Got to Walk That Lonesome Valley” comes from early 20th‑century American folk and gospel tradition. It appeared in hymnals like <em>American Folk Songs for Religious Use</em> (c. 1900–1915), and later was popularized by artists such as the Monroe Brothers and Woody Guthrie. The Million Dollar Quartet (Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash) also recorded “Jesus Walked That Lonesome Valley” with an extra verse.</p>

  <h3>Key Difference</h3>
  <p>The root lyric says, “you gotta walk it by yourself,” emphasizing isolation before God. My version turns that lament into testimony — <strong>“you don’t walk it by yourself.”</strong> In Christ, we are never abandoned; He walks with us.</p>

You Got to Walk That Lonesome Valley
(Traditional Spiritual, Public Domain)

You got to walk that lonesome valley,
You got to walk it by yourself.
Ain’t nobody else can walk it for you,
You got to walk it by yourself.

My mother had to walk that lonesome valley,
She had to walk it by herself.
Ain’t nobody else could walk it for her,
She had to walk it by herself.

My father had to walk that lonesome valley,
He had to walk it by himself.
Ain’t nobody else could walk it for him,
He had to walk it by himself.

Jesus walked this lonesome valley,
He had to walk it by Himself.
Oh, nobody else could walk it for Him,
He had to walk it by Himself.

You got to walk that lonesome valley,
You got to walk it by yourself.
Ain’t nobody else can walk it for you,
You got to walk it by yourself.

      <p><em>No Fellowship with Darkness</em> — an original acoustic-blues song exposing the spiritual compromise behind Halloween and the call for believers to live set apart. This is not a song of condemnation but of clarity — a cry to remember who we serve and to walk as children of light.</p>

      <h3>About the Song</h3>
      <p>We’ve blended so much with the world that we call darkness “fun.” I’m not here to condemn anyone — only to remind us what God’s Word says. Now it’s between you and the Lord, and what the Holy Spirit shows you.</p>
      <p>We live in a world that calls darkness fun — a night of masks and shadows — but Christ calls us out of that fellowship and into His marvelous Light. This song was written to remind the Church: we don’t celebrate death; we serve the Living God.</p>

      <p>This track blends old-school street blues with prophetic spoken word — a father’s warning to his son against temptation, greed, and the voices that promise gain but lead to ruin.</p>

      <p>With a resonator slide guitar, walking bass, and mournful harmonica under a gravel-voiced delivery, the song walks the line between sermon and lament. It’s not polished — it’s real. It’s wisdom crying out in the noise of the world.</p>

      <p><strong>Genres:</strong> acoustic, soulful, blues, raw, dark</p>

      <p>This original gospel-blues song is a cry from the street corner — a harmonica-driven, raw and mournful blues about the world’s desperate need for Jesus. It blends gritty imagery of darkness and lost souls with the hope and fire of the Gospel.</p>

      <p>The verses call out to the harlots, the dreamers, the broken, and the weary — those counting the cost of life without Christ. The pre-chorus rises as a soul-deep conviction: <em>“Proclaim His Word.”</em> And the chorus declares the mission: <em>“How will they know if we don’t show ’em Jesus? How will they hear if we don’t speak His name?”</em></p>

      <p>With harmonica weeping through every line, the bridge unleashes the sound of redemption — guitar and harp together cutting through the night. The song closes with a mournful harmonica outro, echoing the Gospel into the silence.</p>

      <p>📖 Inspired by scriptures like Romans 10:14 (“How shall they hear without a preacher?”) and Matthew 5:14–16 (“You are the light of the world… let your light shine before others.”), this song is both a lament and a call to action.</p>

<h3>Production Note</h3>
<p>I almost wasn’t able to produce this song. When I went to put the Scriptures in, I used my ESV in the program I use to generate the music and vocals. After working on it, the program told me it couldn’t continue because the text was copyrighted. Yes — the Bible is copyrighted. I should say the newer versions are copyrighted.</p>
<p>So I switched to the King James Version, and it still came back saying it was copyrighted. That couldn’t be true. To move forward, I had to put a disclaimer at the top, where you normally give instructions for how you want your song to sound:</p>
<blockquote>[Note: All source text is from the King James Bible (1611), which is public domain.]</blockquote>
<p>That finally let me finish producing the song.</p>

    message: `<h2>Sinner vs. Saint: Identity in Christ</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>It is common for Christians to say, “I am just a sinner.” At first, this sounds like humility. But when we compare it with the New Testament’s language, something feels off. Scripture consistently calls believers saints, children of God, and new creations — never sinners. This raises an important question: Should a Christian identify as a sinner, or has Christ given us a new identity that we must embrace?</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Thesis Statement</h3>
<p>A Christian’s identity is not “sinner.” In Christ, believers are called saints, new creations, and children of God. True repentance means turning away from sin and dying to the old self. Christians are not meant to continue sinning as a way of life (Rom. 6:1–2; 1 John 3:9). Yes, we stumble at times, but those stumbles do not define who we are. The truth of the gospel is this: we are saints in Christ who may occasionally stumble, not sinners who occasionally do something right.</p>

<h4>Clarification</h4>
<p>This is not a claim of perfection or sinless living. Scripture is plain: “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves” (1 John 1:8). Christians still wrestle with temptation and must confess their sins (1 John 1:9). But imperfection does not equal identity. <em>Sinner</em> describes our condition before Christ; <em>saint</em> describes our condition after Christ.</p>

<h3>Paul and John on Sin and Identity</h3>

<h4>Paul’s Teaching</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Formerly a sinner:</strong> “Though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent” (1 Tim. 1:13). The Greek adverb πρότερον (<em>proteron</em>) means “formerly, once, in the past.” It points to Paul’s old life, not his current state.<sup>1</sup></li>
  <li><strong>“Chief of sinners” clarified:</strong> In verse 15 Paul says, “of whom I am (εἰμί, <em>eimi</em>) foremost.” Though this is present tense, NT Greek often uses present verbs to express a category or rhetorical emphasis rather than strict time reference. Paul uses this as humble self-categorization, not as a doctrinal statement of his present identity. Verse 16 makes this explicit: Paul became an example of Christ’s perfect patience, not proof that he remained a sinner.<sup>2</sup></li>
  <li><strong>New identity:</strong> Elsewhere Paul never calls Christians sinners. He addresses believers as saints (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2; Eph. 1:1). He insists they are dead to sin and alive to God (Rom. 6:11), new creations (2 Cor. 5:17), and under no condemnation (Rom. 8:1).</li>
</ul>

<h4>John’s Teaching</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Acknowledges sin’s reality:</strong> “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves” (1 John 1:8). Christians still stumble, but they confess and are cleansed (1 John 1:9).</li>
  <li><strong>Not a lifestyle of sin:</strong> “No one born of God makes a practice of sinning” (1 John 3:9). The Greek phrase ποιεῖν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν (<em>poiein tēn hamartian</em>) indicates ongoing, habitual sin, not occasional failure.<sup>3</sup></li>
  <li><strong>Born sinners, reborn saints:</strong> Scripture affirms original sin — “Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity” (Ps. 51:5). All are born sinners (Rom. 3:23). But in Christ, believers are reborn as saints and children of God (1 John 3:1–2).</li>

<h3>Theological &amp; Practical Implications</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>How we speak about ourselves</strong> — Words shape identity. To call ourselves “just sinners” reinforces an identity Scripture says is dead. The New Testament never uses this label for believers but consistently calls them saints.</li>
  <li><strong>Assurance in Christ</strong> — Identifying as a sinner can erode confidence and keep believers in constant doubt. Identifying as a saint honors Christ’s finished work and strengthens assurance (Rom. 8:1).</li>
  <li><strong>Motivation for holiness</strong> — If I believe I am a sinner, sin feels inevitable. If I believe I am a saint, holiness becomes the expectation.</li>
  <li><strong>Humility rightly understood</strong> — True humility does not deny what Christ has done. It says: “I was a sinner, but Christ has made me new.” Paul models this by remembering his past while boasting in Christ’s grace (1 Tim. 1:15–16; Gal. 6:14).</li>
  <li><strong>The danger of excuses</strong> — Many Christians misuse “I’m just a sinner” as a “get out of jail free card” for lukewarm living. But Scripture never permits this (Rom. 6:15). Grace restores us when we stumble, but it never excuses sin.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Scripture is black-and-white: all people are born sinners, condemned under sin and separated from God. But those who repent and believe in Christ are forever changed — forgiven, washed, adopted, and made saints. Paul and John both affirm that Christians may stumble, but they are no longer defined as sinners.</p>
<p>To keep calling ourselves “just sinners” is not humility. It denies the new identity Christ purchased and can become an excuse for mediocrity in holiness. The balance of Scripture is this: Christians are not perfect, but they are being perfected. They are not yet sinless, but they are no longer slaves to sin.</p>

<h4>Final Statement</h4>
<p><strong>We must stop identifying as sinners who occasionally do something right.</strong> The gospel declares we are saints in Christ who may occasionally stumble — but our true identity is forever rooted in Him.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
  <li>πρότερον (<em>proteron</em>): “formerly, earlier, once” — used of past states, not present identity (cf. Gal. 4:13).</li>
  <li>Greek present εἰμί (<em>eimi</em>) can express a category or ongoing truth, not necessarily a current state of being; compare 1 Cor. 15:9 — “I am the least of the apostles.”</li>
  <li>ποιεῖν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν (<em>poiein tēn hamartian</em>) = “to practice sin” (1 John 3:9). The verb <em>poiein</em> indicates habitual practice, not isolated acts.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<h3>Personal Addendum</h3>
<p>This is something I've been thinking about for a long time now. How we identify ourselves: “I am just a sinner.” I understand why this is said. But it has always felt off to me. I am not trying to condemn anybody for saying it. You may not agree with me — which is fine. We can even have a conversation about it and you can let me know why I am wrong. We can end up just agreeing to disagree — no problem. As I’ve said many times before, everyone has a right to be wrong — lol.</p>

<h4>Additional Note</h4>
<p>This song — or the statement — does not mean I believe in “once saved, always saved.” I do believe it is possible for us to willfully fall away and become shipwrecked. But this does not happen simply when you stumble or fall, as long as you repent, turn away, and keep following Christ. One thing I once heard from a pastor at the church I used to attend is that salvation is like Tupperware — you have to try very hard to destroy it, and that’s not easy. I may not have agreed with him on other things, bu...`

<p><strong>Creation Date:</strong> 3 Oct 2025</p>
<p><strong>Genres:</strong> Acoustic Rock, Worship, Revival</p>

<p><em>Wake-Up Call (Make Us Disciple-Makers Again)</em> is an acoustic-rock anthem calling the church to rise from complacency and return to Jesus’ command in the Great Commission. Too many have reduced evangelism to sitting in pews, giving tithes, or handing out quick invitations. But Christ has called us to more: to pray, to care, and to share until disciples are made who will go and make more disciples.</p>

<p>This song is a cry for revival:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prayer</strong> — because only God changes hearts.</li>
<li><strong>Care</strong> — because love opens the door to truth.</li>
<li><strong>Share</strong> — because the gospel must be proclaimed.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s time to leave the building and go boldly into homes, streets, and communities — with compassion, with truth, and with the fire of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>👉 If this song stirs your heart, share it and join the call to be a disciple-maker again.</p>`

<p><em>Living in a Fallen World</em> is a gritty rock/metal anthem that wrestles with the pain and brokenness all around us — addiction, anger, silence, and lies. It’s real. It’s raw. But it doesn’t stop there. The song declares that only Christ can break the chains of sin, heal the wounds within, and anchor our souls. Even when scars remain, His mercy meets us in the pain. This song is for anyone who’s ever looked at the darkness and wondered if hope is too far. The answer is clear: Christ has overcome....
<p>🎧 Listen, share, and let the truth of the Cross remind you — the curse has lost its place.</p>`

    message: `<h2>Strike at the Light</h2>
<p><strong>Genres:</strong> Acoustic, Worship, Rock, Anthem</p>

<p><em>Strike at the Light</em> is a powerful acoustic-worship anthem exposing the lie of self-reliance and declaring the victory of Christ’s light over darkness.</p>

<p>We live in a world where many try to claw their way out of despair by their own strength — yet remain blind to the truth. Scripture tells us:</p>
<blockquote>“The god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.” (2 Corinthians 4:4)</blockquote>

<p>This song is a response to that blindness. It’s about what happens when hearts glimpse the Light but refuse to surrender — striking at the very truth that exposes them. And it’s about the ultimate triumph of Christ, the Light who shines in the darkness… and the darkness has not overcome it (John 1:5).</p>

<p>🎶 If you’ve ever felt the battle between despair and hope, or seen the world lash out at truth, this song is for you. The message is clear: You can strike at the Light, but the Light remains.</p>`

<p><strong>Genres:</strong> Rock, Metal, Dark, Raw, Worship</p>

<p><em>That Dragon – Serpent of Deceit</em> is a bold anthem confronting the lie that we can conquer sin on our own. The world says, “fight your demons” or “just run away,” but the truth is clear: those are lies. Self-reliance cannot save us.</p>

<p>This song is my response to the growing trend in music videos that promise strength, healing, or escape through self-reliance — while leaving Christ out completely. They may look good and sound fantastic, but behind the message is the same old deception: pride in self.</p>

<p>This song unmasks that lie and points to the only true hope: Jesus Christ, who crushed the serpent’s head, conquered death, and paid the price for our sin.</p>

<p>🐉 If this message speaks to you, please share it — so more people can see the truth behind the serpent’s deception.</p>`
