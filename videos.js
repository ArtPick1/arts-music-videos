      <h2>No Fellowship with Darkness</h2>
      <p><strong>🎸 Genre:</strong> Acoustic Blues · Raw · Prophetic · Spoken-Word Grit</p>
      <p><strong>📖 Scripture:</strong> Ephesians 5:11 · 2 Corinthians 6:14–18 · Deuteronomy 18:9–14</p>
      <p><em>No Fellowship with Darkness</em> — an original acoustic-blues song exposing the spiritual compromise behind Halloween and the call for believers to live set apart. This is not a song of condemnation but of clarity — a cry to remember who we serve and to walk as children of light.</p>
      <blockquote>“Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.” (Ephesians 5:11)</blockquote>
      <h3>About the Song</h3>
      <p>We’ve blended so much with the world that we call darkness “fun.” I’m not here to condemn anyone — only to remind us what God’s Word says. Now it’s between you and the Lord, and what the Holy Spirit shows you.</p>
      <p>We live in a world that calls darkness fun — a night of masks and shadows — but Christ calls us out of that fellowship and into His marvelous Light. This song was written to remind the Church: we don’t celebrate death; we serve the Living God.</p>

      <p>This world calls it fun — a night of masks and shadows.<br/>
      But I remember what my Father said: “Come out from among them, and be ye separate.”<br/>

      <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> Proverbs 1:7–16</p>

      <p><em>Chains of Grace (A Father’s Warning)</em> — a raw, acoustic blues performance inspired by <strong>Proverbs 1:7–16</strong>.</p>

      <p>This track blends old-school street blues with prophetic spoken word — a father’s warning to his son against temptation, greed, and the voices that promise gain but lead to ruin.</p>

      <p>With a resonator slide guitar, walking bass, and mournful harmonica under a gravel-voiced delivery, the song walks the line between sermon and lament. It’s not polished — it’s real. It’s wisdom crying out in the noise of the world.</p>

      <blockquote>“The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.”</blockquote>

      <p><strong>🎙️ Vocal Style:</strong> Deep bass / spoken-sung grit (half-preached, half-sung)</p>
      <p><strong>🎸 Instrumentation:</strong> Resonator slide guitar · upright bass · snare/brush kit · harmonica · light organ drone</p>

      <p><em>This video follows a father and son through a single day — from dawn to dusk — as wisdom is passed down in the stillness of the countryside.</em></p>

      <p>If this message hits home, share it — someone out there needs a father’s warning.</p>

      <h2>Light Up the Shadows</h2>
      <p><strong>Creation Date:</strong> 10 Oct 2025, 1:56 PM</p>
      <p><strong>Genres:</strong> acoustic, soulful, blues, raw, dark</p>

      <p>This original gospel-blues song is a cry from the street corner — a harmonica-driven, raw and mournful blues about the world’s desperate need for Jesus. It blends gritty imagery of darkness and lost souls with the hope and fire of the Gospel.</p>

      <p>The verses call out to the harlots, the dreamers, the broken, and the weary — those counting the cost of life without Christ. The pre-chorus rises as a soul-deep conviction: <em>“Proclaim His Word.”</em> And the chorus declares the mission: <em>“How will they know if we don’t show ’em Jesus? How will they hear if we don’t speak His name?”</em></p>

      <p>With harmonica weeping through every line, the bridge unleashes the sound of redemption — guitar and harp together cutting through the night. The song closes with a mournful harmonica outro, echoing the Gospel into the silence.</p>

      <p>📖 Inspired by scriptures like Romans 10:14 (“How shall they hear without a preacher?”) and Matthew 5:14–16 (“You are the light of the world… let your light shine before others.”), this song is both a lament and a call to action.</p>

<h3>Psalm 30 &amp; Ephesians 5:18 – From Mourning to Dancing</h3>
<p>This original song blends the words of King David in Psalm 30 with the exhortation of Paul in Ephesians 5:18: “Do not be drunk with wine, which is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit…”</p>
<p>It begins with Paul’s command to live Spirit-filled lives, then journeys through David’s raw lament, his cry for mercy, and the triumphant joy of God’s deliverance. The verses wrestle with sorrow and desperation, but the chorus bursts with eternal hope: <em>“Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning!”</em></p>
<p>With a gritty rock/blues edge, this song proclaims thanksgiving, worship, and the transforming power of God — the One who turns mourning into dancing.</p>

<h3>Production Note</h3>
<p>I almost wasn’t able to produce this song. When I went to put the Scriptures in, I used my ESV in the program I use to generate the music and vocals. After working on it, the program told me it couldn’t continue because the text was copyrighted. Yes — the Bible is copyrighted. I should say the newer versions are copyrighted.</p>
<p>So I switched to the King James Version, and it still came back saying it was copyrighted. That couldn’t be true. To move forward, I had to put a disclaimer at the top, where you normally give instructions for how you want your song to sound:</p>
<blockquote>[Note: All source text is from the King James Bible (1611), which is public domain.]</blockquote>
<p>That finally let me finish producing the song.</p>

    message: `<h2>Sinner vs. Saint: Identity in Christ</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>It is common for Christians to say, “I am just a sinner.” At first, this sounds like humility. But when we compare it with the New Testament’s language, something feels off. Scripture consistently calls believers saints, children of God, and new creations — never sinners. This raises an important question: Should a Christian identify as a sinner, or has Christ given us a new identity that we must embrace?</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Thesis Statement</h3>
<p>A Christian’s identity is not “sinner.” In Christ, believers are called saints, new creations, and children of God. True repentance means turning away from sin and dying to the old self. Christians are not meant to continue sinning as a way of life (Rom. 6:1–2; 1 John 3:9). Yes, we stumble at times, but those stumbles do not define who we are. The truth of the gospel is this: we are saints in Christ who may occasionally stumble, not sinners who occasionally do something right.</p>

<h4>Clarification</h4>
<p>This is not a claim of perfection or sinless living. Scripture is plain: “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves” (1 John 1:8). Christians still wrestle with temptation and must confess their sins (1 John 1:9). But imperfection does not equal identity. <em>Sinner</em> describes our condition before Christ; <em>saint</em> describes our condition after Christ.</p>

<h3>Paul and John on Sin and Identity</h3>

<h4>Paul’s Teaching</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Formerly a sinner:</strong> “Though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent” (1 Tim. 1:13). The Greek adverb πρότερον (<em>proteron</em>) means “formerly, once, in the past.” It points to Paul’s old life, not his current state.<sup>1</sup></li>
  <li><strong>“Chief of sinners” clarified:</strong> In verse 15 Paul says, “of whom I am (εἰμί, <em>eimi</em>) foremost.” Though this is present tense, NT Greek often uses present verbs to express a category or rhetorical emphasis rather than strict time reference. Paul uses this as humble self-categorization, not as a doctrinal statement of his present identity. Verse 16 makes this explicit: Paul became an example of Christ’s perfect patience, not proof that he remained a sinner.<sup>2</sup></li>
  <li><strong>New identity:</strong> Elsewhere Paul never calls Christians sinners. He addresses believers as saints (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2; Eph. 1:1). He insists they are dead to sin and alive to God (Rom. 6:11), new creations (2 Cor. 5:17), and under no condemnation (Rom. 8:1).</li>
</ul>

<h4>John’s Teaching</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Acknowledges sin’s reality:</strong> “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves” (1 John 1:8). Christians still stumble, but they confess and are cleansed (1 John 1:9).</li>
  <li><strong>Not a lifestyle of sin:</strong> “No one born of God makes a practice of sinning” (1 John 3:9). The Greek phrase ποιεῖν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν (<em>poiein tēn hamartian</em>) indicates ongoing, habitual sin, not occasional failure.<sup>3</sup></li>
  <li><strong>Born sinners, reborn saints:</strong> Scripture affirms original sin — “Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity” (Ps. 51:5). All are born sinners (Rom. 3:23). But in Christ, believers are reborn as saints and children of God (1 John 3:1–2).</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h3>Timeline of Identity</h3>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Stage</th><th>Identity</th><th>Scripture</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Before Christ</td><td>Sinner by nature — born in sin, enslaved to sin, under wrath</td><td>Ps. 51:5; Rom. 3:23; Eph. 2:1–3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>At Conversion</td><td>Forgiven — washed, justified, adopted</td><td>Acts 22:16; Rom. 5:1; Gal. 4:4–7</td></tr>
    <tr><td>After Conversion</td><td>Saint / Child of God — new creation, dead to sin, alive in Christ</td><td>2 Cor. 5:17; Rom. 6:11; 1 John 3:1–2</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<hr/>

<h3>Theological &amp; Practical Implications</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>How we speak about ourselves</strong> — Words shape identity. To call ourselves “just sinners” reinforces an identity Scripture says is dead. The New Testament never uses this label for believers but consistently calls them saints.</li>
  <li><strong>Assurance in Christ</strong> — Identifying as a sinner can erode confidence and keep believers in constant doubt. Identifying as a saint honors Christ’s finished work and strengthens assurance (Rom. 8:1).</li>
  <li><strong>Motivation for holiness</strong> — If I believe I am a sinner, sin feels inevitable. If I believe I am a saint, holiness becomes the expectation.</li>
  <li><strong>Humility rightly understood</strong> — True humility does not deny what Christ has done. It says: “I was a sinner, but Christ has made me new.” Paul models this by remembering his past while boasting in Christ’s grace (1 Tim. 1:15–16; Gal. 6:14).</li>
  <li><strong>The danger of excuses</strong> — Many Christians misuse “I’m just a sinner” as a “get out of jail free card” for lukewarm living. But Scripture never permits this (Rom. 6:15). Grace restores us when we stumble, but it never excuses sin.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Scripture is black-and-white: all people are born sinners, condemned under sin and separated from God. But those who repent and believe in Christ are forever changed — forgiven, washed, adopted, and made saints. Paul and John both affirm that Christians may stumble, but they are no longer defined as sinners.</p>
<p>To keep calling ourselves “just sinners” is not humility. It denies the new identity Christ purchased and can become an excuse for mediocrity in holiness. The balance of Scripture is this: Christians are not perfect, but they are being perfected. They are not yet sinless, but they are no longer slaves to sin.</p>

<h4>Final Statement</h4>
<p><strong>We must stop identifying as sinners who occasionally do something right.</strong> The gospel declares we are saints in Christ who may occasionally stumble — but our true identity is forever rooted in Him.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
  <li>πρότερον (<em>proteron</em>): “formerly, earlier, once” — used of past states, not present identity (cf. Gal. 4:13).</li>
  <li>Greek present εἰμί (<em>eimi</em>) can express a category or ongoing truth, not necessarily a current state of being; compare 1 Cor. 15:9 — “I am the least of the apostles.”</li>
  <li>ποιεῖν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν (<em>poiein tēn hamartian</em>) = “to practice sin” (1 John 3:9). The verb <em>poiein</em> indicates habitual practice, not isolated acts.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<h3>Personal Addendum</h3>
<p>This is something I've been thinking about for a long time now. How we identify ourselves: “I am just a sinner.” I understand why this is said. But it has always felt off to me. I am not trying to condemn anybody for saying it. You may not agree with me — which is fine. We can even have a conversation about it and you can let me know why I am wrong. We can end up just agreeing to disagree — no problem. As I’ve said many times before, everyone has a right to be wrong — lol.</p>

<h4>Additional Note</h4>
<p>This song — or the statement — does not mean I believe in “once saved, always saved.” I do believe it is possible for us to willfully fall away and become shipwrecked. But this does not happen simply when you stumble or fall, as long as you repent, turn away, and keep following Christ. One thing I once heard from a pastor at the church I used to attend is that salvation is like Tupperware — you have to try very hard to destroy it, and that’s not easy. I may not have agreed with him on other things, bu...`

<p><em>Wake-Up Call (Make Us Disciple-Makers Again)</em> is an acoustic-rock anthem calling the church to rise from complacency and return to Jesus’ command in the Great Commission. Too many have reduced evangelism to sitting in pews, giving tithes, or handing out quick invitations. But Christ has called us to more: to pray, to care, and to share until disciples are made who will go and make more disciples.</p>

<p>This song is a cry for revival:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prayer</strong> — because only God changes hearts.</li>
<li><strong>Care</strong> — because love opens the door to truth.</li>
<li><strong>Share</strong> — because the gospel must be proclaimed.</li>

<p><em>Strike at the Light</em> is a powerful acoustic-worship anthem exposing the lie of self-reliance and declaring the victory of Christ’s light over darkness.</p>

<p>We live in a world where many try to claw their way out of despair by their own strength — yet remain blind to the truth. Scripture tells us:</p>
<blockquote>“The god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.” (2 Corinthians 4:4)</blockquote>

<p>This song is a response to that blindness. It’s about what happens when hearts glimpse the Light but refuse to surrender — striking at the very truth that exposes them. And it’s about the ultimate triumph of Christ, the Light who shines in the darkness… and the darkness has not overcome it (John 1:5).</p>

<p>🎶 If you’ve ever felt the battle between despair and hope, or seen the world lash out at truth, this song is for you. The message is clear: You can strike at the Light, but the Light remains.</p>`
