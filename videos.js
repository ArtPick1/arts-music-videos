    message: `<h2>Sinner vs. Saint: Identity in Christ</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>It is common for Christians to say, “I am just a sinner.” At first, this sounds like humility. But when we compare it with the New Testament’s language, something feels off. Scripture consistently calls believers saints, children of God, and new creations — never sinners. This raises an important question: Should a Christian identify as a sinner, or has Christ given us a new identity that we must embrace?</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Thesis Statement</h3>
<p>A Christian’s identity is not “sinner.” In Christ, believers are called saints, new creations, and children of God. True repentance means turning away from sin and dying to the old self. Christians are not meant to continue sinning as a way of life (Rom. 6:1–2; 1 John 3:9). Yes, we stumble at times, but those stumbles do not define who we are. The truth of the gospel is this: we are saints in Christ who may occasionally stumble, not sinners who occasionally do something right.</p>

<h4>Clarification</h4>
<p>This is not a claim of perfection or sinless living. Scripture is plain: “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves” (1 John 1:8). Christians still wrestle with temptation and must confess their sins (1 John 1:9). But imperfection does not equal identity. <em>Sinner</em> describes our condition before Christ; <em>saint</em> describes our condition after Christ.</p>

<h3>Paul and John on Sin and Identity</h3>

<h4>Paul’s Teaching</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Formerly a sinner:</strong> “Though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent” (1 Tim. 1:13). The Greek adverb πρότερον (<em>proteron</em>) means “formerly, once, in the past.” It points to Paul’s old life, not his current state.<sup>1</sup></li>
  <li><strong>“Chief of sinners” clarified:</strong> In verse 15 Paul says, “of whom I am (εἰμί, <em>eimi</em>) foremost.” Though this is present tense, NT Greek often uses present verbs to express a category or rhetorical emphasis rather than strict time reference. Paul uses this as humble self-categorization, not as a doctrinal statement of his present identity. Verse 16 makes this explicit: Paul became an example of Christ’s perfect patience, not proof that he remained a sinner.<sup>2</sup></li>
  <li><strong>New identity:</strong> Elsewhere Paul never calls Christians sinners. He addresses believers as saints (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2; Eph. 1:1). He insists they are dead to sin and alive to God (Rom. 6:11), new creations (2 Cor. 5:17), and under no condemnation (Rom. 8:1).</li>
</ul>

<h4>John’s Teaching</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Acknowledges sin’s reality:</strong> “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves” (1 John 1:8). Christians still stumble, but they confess and are cleansed (1 John 1:9).</li>
  <li><strong>Not a lifestyle of sin:</strong> “No one born of God makes a practice of sinning” (1 John 3:9). The Greek phrase ποιεῖν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν (<em>poiein tēn hamartian</em>) indicates ongoing, habitual sin, not occasional failure.<sup>3</sup></li>
  <li><strong>Born sinners, reborn saints:</strong> Scripture affirms original sin — “Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity” (Ps. 51:5). All are born sinners (Rom. 3:23). But in Christ, believers are reborn as saints and children of God (1 John 3:1–2).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Timeline of Identity</h3>

  <thead>
    <tr><th>Stage</th><th>Identity</th><th>Scripture</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Before Christ</td><td>Sinner by nature — born in sin, enslaved to sin, under wrath</td><td>Ps. 51:5; Rom. 3:23; Eph. 2:1–3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>At Conversion</td><td>Forgiven — washed, justified, adopted</td><td>Acts 22:16; Rom. 5:1; Gal. 4:4–7</td></tr>
    <tr><td>After Conversion</td><td>Saint / Child of God — new creation, dead to sin, alive in Christ</td><td>2 Cor. 5:17; Rom. 6:11; 1 John 3:1–2</td></tr>

<h3>Theological &amp; Practical Implications</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>How we speak about ourselves</strong> — Words shape identity. To call ourselves “just sinners” reinforces an identity Scripture says is dead. The New Testament never uses this label for believers but consistently calls them saints.</li>
  <li><strong>Assurance in Christ</strong> — Identifying as a sinner can erode confidence and keep believers in constant doubt. Identifying as a saint honors Christ’s finished work and strengthens assurance (Rom. 8:1).</li>
  <li><strong>Motivation for holiness</strong> — If I believe I am a sinner, sin feels inevitable. If I believe I am a saint, holiness becomes the expectation.</li>
  <li><strong>Humility rightly understood</strong> — True humility does not deny what Christ has done. It says: “I was a sinner, but Christ has made me new.” Paul models this by remembering his past while boasting in Christ’s grace (1 Tim. 1:15–16; Gal. 6:14).</li>
  <li><strong>The danger of excuses</strong> — Many Christians misuse “I’m just a sinner” as a “get out of jail free card” for lukewarm living. But Scripture never permits this (Rom. 6:15). Grace restores us when we stumble, but it never excuses sin.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Scripture is black-and-white: all people are born sinners, condemned under sin and separated from God. But those who repent and believe in Christ are forever changed — forgiven, washed, adopted, and made saints. Paul and John both affirm that Christians may stumble, but they are no longer defined as sinners.</p>
<p>To keep calling ourselves “just sinners” is not humility. It denies the new identity Christ purchased and can become an excuse for mediocrity in holiness. The balance of Scripture is this: Christians are not perfect, but they are being perfected. They are not yet sinless, but they are no longer slaves to sin.</p>

<h4>Final Statement</h4>
<p><strong>We must stop identifying as sinners who occasionally do something right.</strong> The gospel declares we are saints in Christ who may occasionally stumble — but our true identity is forever rooted in Him.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
  <li>πρότερον (<em>proteron</em>): “formerly, earlier, once” — used of past states, not present identity (cf. Gal. 4:13).</li>
  <li>Greek present εἰμί (<em>eimi</em>) can express a category or ongoing truth, not necessarily a current state of being; compare 1 Cor. 15:9 — “I am the least of the apostles.”</li>
  <li>ποιεῖν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν (<em>poiein tēn hamartian</em>) = “to practice sin” (1 John 3:9). The verb <em>poiein</em> indicates habitual practice, not isolated acts.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<h3>Personal Addendum</h3>
<p>This is something I've been thinking about for a long time now. How we identify ourselves: “I am just a sinner.” I understand why this is said. But it has always felt off to me. I am not trying to condemn anybody for saying it. You may not agree with me — which is fine. We can even have a conversation about it and you can let me know why I am wrong. We can end up just agreeing to disagree — no problem. As I’ve said many times before, everyone has a right to be wrong — lol.</p>

<h4>Additional Note</h4>
<p>This song — or the statement — does not mean I believe in “once saved, always saved.” I do believe it is possible for us to willfully fall away and become shipwrecked. But this does not happen simply when you stumble or fall, as long as you repent, turn away, and keep following Christ. One thing I once heard from a pastor at the church I used to attend is that salvation is like Tupperware — you have to try very hard to destroy it, and that’s not easy. I may not have agreed with him on other things, but on that point I did agree.</p>`

      <p>This song carries a simple salvation message, but also a serious warning: what we watch, listen to, and consume every day shapes us.</p>
