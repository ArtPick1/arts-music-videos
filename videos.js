    message: `<h2>Christmas at Denny’s</h2>
<p>This song tells a fictional late-night diner story — a blues-style illustration of what it looks like when the Gospel steps into the quiet corners of life. It’s not a real event, but it paints a picture many of us recognize: a weary soul, an empty booth, and a moment where grace breaks through the dark. Inspired by the mood of Randy Stonehill’s Christmas at Denny’s, this song builds its own imagined scene — a reminder of how easily we overlook the people who sit right in front of us, especially during the holidays. This story isn’t something that happened… It’s something that could happen — and something that should remind us how to live. Let this fictional scene push you to look around, slow down, and reach out. Because even made-up stories can reveal real truth about what it means to follow Christ.</p>`

    message: `<h2>Holy Spirit – Awaken the Fire</h2>
<p><em>“Holy Spirit – Awaken the Fire”</em> is a dark acoustic-blues cry for boldness. A prayer from the shadows — for courage, conviction, and the fire of God to rise again.</p>
<p>This isn’t about thrills, goosebumps, or emotional hype. It’s about the Holy Spirit empowering obedience, truth, courage, and a witness that stands firm where others shrink back.</p>
<p>Filmed with gritty, low-light blues imagery — alleyways, embers, shadows, and a lone voice in the dark — this video follows the lyrical journey of calling on the Spirit to ignite boldness again.</p>
<p><strong>No polish. No performance. Just a raw prayer:</strong><br/>
<strong>“Holy Spirit, awaken the fire in me.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>All glory to Jesus Christ alone.</strong></p>`

<p>Written out of a simple prayer: <strong>“Lord, send me Your peace; I’ll rest in Your arms. Do with my life as You see fit.”</strong></p>
<p>This song walks through confession, surrender, and praise — from laying everything down before Him, to lifting His name above everything else.</p>
<p>Shot against an Oklahoma sunset, this video reflects the quiet places where God speaks to the heart and draws us deeper into His will.</p>

    message: `<h2>Lead Me, Lord</h2>
<p>The reason I wrote it began last night after church. On the way home, Cindy asked me what I was feeling about our church. That’s a deep subject for me because of our previous church.</p>
<p>Later that night, while I was working on something else, I kept sensing that I needed to write down what was stirring in my heart and soul.</p>
<p>This song is what came out of that moment — a simple prayer of surrender: <em>“Lead me, Lord… wherever You want me to go.”</em></p>
<p>Lead Me, Lord — a male–female duet built from a simple, honest prayer. A cry for direction, faithfulness, and steady obedience:<br/>
“Help me follow You wherever You lead…<br/>
Keep my heart steady in praise…<br/>
Help me stand firm in Your Word all my days.”</p>
<p>If you’re seeking clarity, surrender, or need to draw near to Christ again — this song is for you.</p>`

  message: `<h2>Not Just Lip Service</h2>
<p><em>“Not Just Lip Service”</em> is a gritty acoustic-blues call to repentance — a cry for revival that starts within. Set in an old urban church at dawn, the song strips away performance and pretension, reminding us that worship without obedience is empty. The harmonica becomes a prayer between verses — the sound of conviction turning to surrender. This song asks the Church to do more than sing for fire from above — to walk the walk, to lay down idols, and to become the altar flame. When our hearts are truly undone, the Spirit can finally heal.</p>

    message: `“Rulers of Sodom” — A Prophetic Cry to a Nation Inspired by Isaiah 1:6–18, this cinematic spoken-word piece confronts a nation wounded from head to toe — morally, spiritually, and culturally. Once blessed and called to righteousness, we now mirror ancient Judah: a people covered in wounds that won’t heal because we keep turning from the only One who can cleanse us. Yet even now, God’s invitation still stands: “Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.” America’s crisis isn’t just political or cultural; it’s spiritual. This message calls us back to the altar — to wash, be made clean, and honor the Holy Name once more. 🎵 Music & Video Production by Art Pickens 📖 Scripture Reference: Isaiah 1:6–18 🕊️ Theme: A warning to modern nations — judgment, repentance, and redemption through Christ.`

    message: `<h2>Lonesome Valley (You Don’t Walk Alone)</h2>
  <p><strong>Context / Why I rewrote it:</strong> As I was searching YouTube for harmonica lessons, I ran across this song and listened to it. Immediately I realized how wrong theologically it was. I understood what they were trying to say, but it just wasn’t right — so I had to rewrite it.</p>

  <h3>About the Original</h3>
  <p>The earliest known version of “You Got to Walk That Lonesome Valley” comes from early 20th‑century American folk and gospel tradition. It appeared in hymnals like <em>American Folk Songs for Religious Use</em> (c. 1900–1915), and later was popularized by artists such as the Monroe Brothers and Woody Guthrie. The Million Dollar Quartet (Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash) also recorded “Jesus Walked That Lonesome Valley” with an extra verse.</p>

  <h3>Key Difference</h3>
  <p>The root lyric says, “you gotta walk it by yourself,” emphasizing isolation before God. My version turns that lament into testimony — <strong>“you don’t walk it by yourself.”</strong> In Christ, we are never abandoned; He walks with us.</p>

You Got to Walk That Lonesome Valley
(Traditional Spiritual, Public Domain)

You got to walk that lonesome valley,
You got to walk it by yourself.
Ain’t nobody else can walk it for you,
You got to walk it by yourself.

My mother had to walk that lonesome valley,
She had to walk it by herself.
Ain’t nobody else could walk it for her,
She had to walk it by herself.

My father had to walk that lonesome valley,
He had to walk it by himself.
Ain’t nobody else could walk it for him,
He had to walk it by himself.

Jesus walked this lonesome valley,
He had to walk it by Himself.
Oh, nobody else could walk it for Him,
He had to walk it by Himself.

You got to walk that lonesome valley,
You got to walk it by yourself.
Ain’t nobody else can walk it for you,
You got to walk it by yourself.

      <p><em>No Fellowship with Darkness</em> — an original acoustic-blues song exposing the spiritual compromise behind Halloween and the call for believers to live set apart. This is not a song of condemnation but of clarity — a cry to remember who we serve and to walk as children of light.</p>
      <blockquote>“Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.” (Ephesians 5:11)</blockquote>
      <h3>About the Song</h3>
      <p>We’ve blended so much with the world that we call darkness “fun.” I’m not here to condemn anyone — only to remind us what God’s Word says. Now it’s between you and the Lord, and what the Holy Spirit shows you.</p>
      <p>We live in a world that calls darkness fun — a night of masks and shadows — but Christ calls us out of that fellowship and into His marvelous Light. This song was written to remind the Church: we don’t celebrate death; we serve the Living God.</p>

      <p><em>Chains of Grace (A Father’s Warning)</em> — a raw, acoustic blues performance inspired by <strong>Proverbs 1:7–16</strong>.</p>

      <p>This track blends old-school street blues with prophetic spoken word — a father’s warning to his son against temptation, greed, and the voices that promise gain but lead to ruin.</p>

      <p>With a resonator slide guitar, walking bass, and mournful harmonica under a gravel-voiced delivery, the song walks the line between sermon and lament. It’s not polished — it’s real. It’s wisdom crying out in the noise of the world.</p>

      <p><strong>Creation Date:</strong> 10 Oct 2025, 1:56 PM</p>
      <p><strong>Genres:</strong> acoustic, soulful, blues, raw, dark</p>

      <p>This original gospel-blues song is a cry from the street corner — a harmonica-driven, raw and mournful blues about the world’s desperate need for Jesus. It blends gritty imagery of darkness and lost souls with the hope and fire of the Gospel.</p>

      <p>The verses call out to the harlots, the dreamers, the broken, and the weary — those counting the cost of life without Christ. The pre-chorus rises as a soul-deep conviction: <em>“Proclaim His Word.”</em> And the chorus declares the mission: <em>“How will they know if we don’t show ’em Jesus? How will they hear if we don’t speak His name?”</em></p>

      <p>With harmonica weeping through every line, the bridge unleashes the sound of redemption — guitar and harp together cutting through the night. The song closes with a mournful harmonica outro, echoing the Gospel into the silence.</p>

      <p>📖 Inspired by scriptures like Romans 10:14 (“How shall they hear without a preacher?”) and Matthew 5:14–16 (“You are the light of the world… let your light shine before others.”), this song is both a lament and a call to action.</p>

<h3>Production Note</h3>
<p>I almost wasn’t able to produce this song. When I went to put the Scriptures in, I used my ESV in the program I use to generate the music and vocals. After working on it, the program told me it couldn’t continue because the text was copyrighted. Yes — the Bible is copyrighted. I should say the newer versions are copyrighted.</p>
<p>So I switched to the King James Version, and it still came back saying it was copyrighted. That couldn’t be true. To move forward, I had to put a disclaimer at the top, where you normally give instructions for how you want your song to sound:</p>
<blockquote>[Note: All source text is from the King James Bible (1611), which is public domain.]</blockquote>
<p>That finally let me finish producing the song.</p>

    message: `<h2>Sinner vs. Saint: Identity in Christ</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>It is common for Christians to say, “I am just a sinner.” At first, this sounds like humility. But when we compare it with the New Testament’s language, something feels off. Scripture consistently calls believers saints, children of God, and new creations — never sinners. This raises an important question: Should a Christian identify as a sinner, or has Christ given us a new identity that we must embrace?</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Thesis Statement</h3>
<p>A Christian’s identity is not “sinner.” In Christ, believers are called saints, new creations, and children of God. True repentance means turning away from sin and dying to the old self. Christians are not meant to continue sinning as a way of life (Rom. 6:1–2; 1 John 3:9). Yes, we stumble at times, but those stumbles do not define who we are. The truth of the gospel is this: we are saints in Christ who may occasionally stumble, not sinners who occasionally do something right.</p>

<h4>Clarification</h4>
<p>This is not a claim of perfection or sinless living. Scripture is plain: “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves” (1 John 1:8). Christians still wrestle with temptation and must confess their sins (1 John 1:9). But imperfection does not equal identity. <em>Sinner</em> describes our condition before Christ; <em>saint</em> describes our condition after Christ.</p>

<h3>Paul and John on Sin and Identity</h3>

<h4>Paul’s Teaching</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Formerly a sinner:</strong> “Though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent” (1 Tim. 1:13). The Greek adverb πρότερον (<em>proteron</em>) means “formerly, once, in the past.” It points to Paul’s old life, not his current state.<sup>1</sup></li>
  <li><strong>“Chief of sinners” clarified:</strong> In verse 15 Paul says, “of whom I am (εἰμί, <em>eimi</em>) foremost.” Though this is present tense, NT Greek often uses present verbs to express a category or rhetorical emphasis rather than strict time reference. Paul uses this as humble self-categorization, not as a doctrinal statement of his present identity. Verse 16 makes this explicit: Paul became an example of Christ’s perfect patience, not proof that he remained a sinner.<sup>2</sup></li>
  <li><strong>New identity:</strong> Elsewhere Paul never calls Christians sinners. He addresses believers as saints (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2; Eph. 1:1). He insists they are dead to sin and alive to God (Rom. 6:11), new creations (2 Cor. 5:17), and under no condemnation (Rom. 8:1).</li>
</ul>

<h4>John’s Teaching</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Acknowledges sin’s reality:</strong> “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves” (1 John 1:8). Christians still stumble, but they confess and are cleansed (1 John 1:9).</li>
  <li><strong>Not a lifestyle of sin:</strong> “No one born of God makes a practice of sinning” (1 John 3:9). The Greek phrase ποιεῖν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν (<em>poiein tēn hamartian</em>) indicates ongoing, habitual sin, not occasional failure.<sup>3</sup></li>
  <li><strong>Born sinners, reborn saints:</strong> Scripture affirms original sin — “Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity” (Ps. 51:5). All are born sinners (Rom. 3:23). But in Christ, believers are reborn as saints and children of God (1 John 3:1–2).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Theological &amp; Practical Implications</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>How we speak about ourselves</strong> — Words shape identity. To call ourselves “just sinners” reinforces an identity Scripture says is dead. The New Testament never uses this label for believers but consistently calls them saints.</li>
  <li><strong>Assurance in Christ</strong> — Identifying as a sinner can erode confidence and keep believers in constant doubt. Identifying as a saint honors Christ’s finished work and strengthens assurance (Rom. 8:1).</li>
  <li><strong>Motivation for holiness</strong> — If I believe I am a sinner, sin feels inevitable. If I believe I am a saint, holiness becomes the expectation.</li>
  <li><strong>Humility rightly understood</strong> — True humility does not deny what Christ has done. It says: “I was a sinner, but Christ has made me new.” Paul models this by remembering his past while boasting in Christ’s grace (1 Tim. 1:15–16; Gal. 6:14).</li>
  <li><strong>The danger of excuses</strong> — Many Christians misuse “I’m just a sinner” as a “get out of jail free card” for lukewarm living. But Scripture never permits this (Rom. 6:15). Grace restores us when we stumble, but it never excuses sin.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Scripture is black-and-white: all people are born sinners, condemned under sin and separated from God. But those who repent and believe in Christ are forever changed — forgiven, washed, adopted, and made saints. Paul and John both affirm that Christians may stumble, but they are no longer defined as sinners.</p>
<p>To keep calling ourselves “just sinners” is not humility. It denies the new identity Christ purchased and can become an excuse for mediocrity in holiness. The balance of Scripture is this: Christians are not perfect, but they are being perfected. They are not yet sinless, but they are no longer slaves to sin.</p>

<h4>Final Statement</h4>
<p><strong>We must stop identifying as sinners who occasionally do something right.</strong> The gospel declares we are saints in Christ who may occasionally stumble — but our true identity is forever rooted in Him.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
  <li>πρότερον (<em>proteron</em>): “formerly, earlier, once” — used of past states, not present identity (cf. Gal. 4:13).</li>
  <li>Greek present εἰμί (<em>eimi</em>) can express a category or ongoing truth, not necessarily a current state of being; compare 1 Cor. 15:9 — “I am the least of the apostles.”</li>
  <li>ποιεῖν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν (<em>poiein tēn hamartian</em>) = “to practice sin” (1 John 3:9). The verb <em>poiein</em> indicates habitual practice, not isolated acts.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<h3>Personal Addendum</h3>
<p>This is something I've been thinking about for a long time now. How we identify ourselves: “I am just a sinner.” I understand why this is said. But it has always felt off to me. I am not trying to condemn anybody for saying it. You may not agree with me — which is fine. We can even have a conversation about it and you can let me know why I am wrong. We can end up just agreeing to disagree — no problem. As I’ve said many times before, everyone has a right to be wrong — lol.</p>

<h4>Additional Note</h4>
<p>This song — or the statement — does not mean I believe in “once saved, always saved.” I do believe it is possible for us to willfully fall away and become shipwrecked. But this does not happen simply when you stumble or fall, as long as you repent, turn away, and keep following Christ. One thing I once heard from a pastor at the church I used to attend is that salvation is like Tupperware — you have to try very hard to destroy it, and that’s not easy. I may not have agreed with him on other things, bu...`

<p><strong>Genres:</strong> Acoustic Rock, Worship, Revival</p>

<p><em>Wake-Up Call (Make Us Disciple-Makers Again)</em> is an acoustic-rock anthem calling the church to rise from complacency and return to Jesus’ command in the Great Commission. Too many have reduced evangelism to sitting in pews, giving tithes, or handing out quick invitations. But Christ has called us to more: to pray, to care, and to share until disciples are made who will go and make more disciples.</p>

<p>This song is a cry for revival:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prayer</strong> — because only God changes hearts.</li>
<li><strong>Care</strong> — because love opens the door to truth.</li>
<li><strong>Share</strong> — because the gospel must be proclaimed.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s time to leave the building and go boldly into homes, streets, and communities — with compassion, with truth, and with the fire of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>👉 If this song stirs your heart, share it and join the call to be a disciple-maker again.</p>`

<p><em>Living in a Fallen World</em> is a gritty rock/metal anthem that wrestles with the pain and brokenness all around us — addiction, anger, silence, and lies. It’s real. It’s raw. But it doesn’t stop there. The song declares that only Christ can break the chains of sin, heal the wounds within, and anchor our souls. Even when scars remain, His mercy meets us in the pain. This song is for anyone who’s ever looked at the darkness and wondered if hope is too far. The answer is clear: Christ has overcome....

    message: `<h2>Strike at the Light</h2>
<p><strong>Genres:</strong> Acoustic, Worship, Rock, Anthem</p>

<p><em>Strike at the Light</em> is a powerful acoustic-worship anthem exposing the lie of self-reliance and declaring the victory of Christ’s light over darkness.</p>

<p>We live in a world where many try to claw their way out of despair by their own strength — yet remain blind to the truth. Scripture tells us:</p>
<blockquote>“The god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.” (2 Corinthians 4:4)</blockquote>

<p>This song is a response to that blindness. It’s about what happens when hearts glimpse the Light but refuse to surrender — striking at the very truth that exposes them. And it’s about the ultimate triumph of Christ, the Light who shines in the darkness… and the darkness has not overcome it (John 1:5).</p>

<p>🎶 If you’ve ever felt the battle between despair and hope, or seen the world lash out at truth, this song is for you. The message is clear: You can strike at the Light, but the Light remains.</p>`

<p><strong>Genres:</strong> Rock, Metal, Dark, Raw, Worship</p>

<p><em>That Dragon – Serpent of Deceit</em> is a bold anthem confronting the lie that we can conquer sin on our own. The world says, “fight your demons” or “just run away,” but the truth is clear: those are lies. Self-reliance cannot save us.</p>

<p>This song is my response to the growing trend in music videos that promise strength, healing, or escape through self-reliance — while leaving Christ out completely. They may look good and sound fantastic, but behind the message is the same old deception: pride in self.</p>

<p>This song unmasks that lie and points to the only true hope: Jesus Christ, who crushed the serpent’s head, conquered death, and paid the price for our sin.</p>

<p>🐉 If this message speaks to you, please share it — so more people can see the truth behind the serpent’s deception.</p>`
