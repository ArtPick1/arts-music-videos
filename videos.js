    title: "Why Go to Church?",
    url: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/KIF8zRQWsis",
    description: "This song addresses one of the most common modern objections to Christian life: \"Why do I even need to go to church?\" It‚Äôs a heartfelt yet confrontational answer to the rise of isolation, hurt from past church experiences, and the cultural drift toward \"just me and Jesus\" Christianity. Rooted in Hebrews 10:25, it affirms the importance of gathering with other believers‚Äînot out of obligation, but because it‚Äôs essential for encouragement, growth, correction, worship, and spiritual warfare. The tone is compassionate but clear: the Church isn‚Äôt perfect, but God still calls us to be part of His Body ‚Äî together."
