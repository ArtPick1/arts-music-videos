    <h2>Chains of Grace (A Father’s Warning)</h2>
    <p><strong>Genres:</strong> Acoustic · Blues · Raw · Gritty · Dark</p>
    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> Proverbs 1:7–16</p>

    <p><em>Chains of Grace (A Father’s Warning)</em> — a raw, acoustic blues performance inspired by <strong>Proverbs 1:7–16</strong>.</p>

    <p>This track blends old-school street blues with prophetic spoken word — a father’s warning to his son against temptation, greed, and the voices that promise gain but lead to ruin.</p>

    <p>With a resonator slide guitar, walking bass, and mournful harmonica under a gravel-voiced delivery, the song walks the line between sermon and lament. It’s not polished — it’s real. It’s wisdom crying out in the noise of the world.</p>

    <blockquote>“The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.”</blockquote>

    <p><strong>🎙️ Vocal Style:</strong> Deep bass / spoken-sung grit (half-preached, half-sung)</p>
    <p><strong>🎸 Instrumentation:</strong> Resonator slide guitar · upright bass · snare/brush kit · harmonica · light organ drone</p>

    <p><em>This video follows a father and son through a single day — from dawn to dusk — as wisdom is passed down in the stillness of the countryside.</em></p>

    <p>If this message hits home, share it — someone out there needs a father’s warning.</p>

      <h2>Light Up the Shadows</h2>
      <p><strong>Creation Date:</strong> 10 Oct 2025, 1:56 PM</p>
      <p><strong>Genres:</strong> acoustic, soulful, blues, raw, dark</p>

      <p>This original gospel-blues song is a cry from the street corner — a harmonica-driven, raw and mournful blues about the world’s desperate need for Jesus. It blends gritty imagery of darkness and lost souls with the hope and fire of the Gospel.</p>

      <p>The verses call out to the harlots, the dreamers, the broken, and the weary — those counting the cost of life without Christ. The pre-chorus rises as a soul-deep conviction: <em>“Proclaim His Word.”</em> And the chorus declares the mission: <em>“How will they know if we don’t show ’em Jesus? How will they hear if we don’t speak His name?”</em></p>

      <p>With harmonica weeping through every line, the bridge unleashes the sound of redemption — guitar and harp together cutting through the night. The song closes with a mournful harmonica outro, echoing the Gospel into the silence.</p>

      <p>📖 Inspired by scriptures like Romans 10:14 (“How shall they hear without a preacher?”) and Matthew 5:14–16 (“You are the light of the world… let your light shine before others.”), this song is both a lament and a call to action.</p>
