      <h2>Rulers of Sodom</h2>
      <p><strong>🎧 Genre:</strong> Cinematic Spoken Word · Prophetic Cry</p>
      <p><strong>📖 Scripture Reference:</strong> Isaiah 1:6–18</p>
      <p>“Rulers of Sodom” — A Prophetic Cry to a Nation inspired by Isaiah 1:6–18, this cinematic spoken-word piece confronts a nation wounded from head to toe — morally, spiritually, and culturally. Once blessed and called to righteousness, we now mirror ancient Judah: a people covered in wounds that won’t heal because we keep turning from the only One who can cleanse us.</p>
      <p>Yet even now, God’s invitation still stands: “Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.” America’s crisis isn’t just political or cultural; it’s spiritual. This message calls us back to the altar — to wash, be made clean, and honor the Holy Name once more.</p>

      <p>🕊️ Theme: A warning to modern nations — judgment, repentance, and redemption through Christ.</p>
