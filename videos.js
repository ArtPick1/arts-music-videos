Introduction
It is common for Christians to say, “I am just a sinner.” At first, this sounds like humility. But when we compare it with the New Testament’s language, something feels off.

Additional Note:
This song — or the statement — does not mean I believe in “once saved, always saved.” I do believe it is possible for us to willfully fall away and become shipwrecked.

One thing I once heard from a pastor at the church I used to attend is that salvation is like Tupperware — you have to try very hard to destroy it, and that’s not easy. I may not have agreed with him on other things, but on that point I did agree.`
