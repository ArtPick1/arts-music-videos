      <p><strong>Sinner vs. Saint: Identity in Christ</strong></p>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>It is common for Christians to say, “I am just a sinner.” At first, this sounds like humility. But when we compare it with the New Testament’s language, something feels off. Scripture consistently calls believers saints, children of God, and new creations — never sinners. This raises an important question: Should a Christian identify as a sinner, or has Christ given us a new identity that we must embrace?</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Thesis Statement</h3>
      <p>A Christian’s identity is not “sinner.” In Christ, believers are called saints, new creations, and children of God. True repentance means turning away from sin and dying to the old self. Christians are not meant to continue sinning as a way of life (Rom. 6:1–2; 1 John 3:9). Yes, we stumble at times, but those stumbles do not define who we are. The truth of the gospel is this: we are saints in Christ who may occasionally stumble, not sinners who occasionally do something right.</p>
      <h4>Clarification</h4>
      <p>This is not a claim of perfection or sinless living. Scripture is plain: “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves” (1 John 1:8). Christians still wrestle with temptation and must confess their sins (1 John 1:9). But imperfection does not equal identity. <em>Sinner</em> describes our condition before Christ; <em>saint</em> describes our condition after Christ.</p>

      <h3>Sinner vs. Saint — Identity Traits</h3>
      <table style="width:100%; border-collapse:collapse">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th style="text-align:left; border-bottom:1px solid #202733">Sinner (Before Christ)</th>
            <th style="text-align:left; border-bottom:1px solid #202733">Saint (In Christ)</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>Defined by sin (Eph. 2:1–3)</td><td>Defined by grace (Eph. 2:4–6)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Slave to sin (Rom. 6:6, 20)</td><td>Slave to righteousness (Rom. 6:18)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Old self/nature (Col. 3:9)</td><td>New creation (2 Cor. 5:17)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Under condemnation (Rom. 8:1, outside Christ)</td><td>No condemnation in Christ (Rom. 8:1)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Separated from God (Isa. 59:2)</td><td>Reconciled to God (Rom. 5:10)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Dead in trespasses (Eph. 2:1)</td><td>Alive in Christ (Rom. 6:11)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Enemy of God (Rom. 5:10)</td><td>Child of God (1 John 3:1–2)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Habitual practice of sin (1 John 3:8)</td><td>Called to holiness (1 Pet. 1:15–16)</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Scripture is clear: all are born sinners, but those who repent and believe are forgiven, adopted, and made saints. We may stumble, but we are no longer defined as sinners.</p>
      <p><strong>Final Statement:</strong> We must stop identifying as sinners who occasionally do something right. The gospel declares we are saints in Christ who may occasionally stumble — but our true identity is forever rooted in Him.</p>

      <p>This song carries a simple salvation message, but also a serious warning: what we watch, listen to, and consume every day shapes us. The serpent who deceived in the Garden is still at work, roaming the earth, filling hearts and minds with lies that blind people to the light of Christ.</p>
      <p>The lyrics cry out against these “voices in your head” — voices that call evil good and good as dead, voices that twist truth until confusion seems normal. Much of today’s media does this in subtle ways. It doesn’t always look evil on the surface, but it dulls our hearts and distracts us from Christ.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the song points to hope. Deep within, there is still a Voice that calls: “Come — you have a choice.” That voice is not the heart (which is deceitful), but Christ Himself, breaking the chains of demonic lies through the cross.</p>
      <p>If you’re not truly a disciple of Jesus, I urge you to consider Him. He is the way, the truth, and the life. And if you are a believer, guard your mind and soul — because the enemy is relentless in trying to drown out the still small voice of God with countless false ones.</p>

      <p>I wrote this song after seeing a post on Facebook that said:</p>
      <blockquote><p>“If I sinned a thousand sins today, the one thing I did do right was stay sober. Thankful for that. Let’s stay sober tomorrow.”</p></blockquote>
      <p>Now, I realize the writer was exaggerating with “a thousand sins in a day.” To do that, you’d have to sin once every 90 seconds for 24 hours straight. None of us are perfect, and yes, we stumble — but if sin still rules your life, it raises the question: have you truly repented and turned to Christ?</p>
      <p>Too many people hide behind the excuse “I’m not perfect” as a way to continue in their sin. But Scripture tells us otherwise:</p>
      <h3>Christ Our Advocate<br><small>1 John 2:1–6 (ESV)</small></h3>
      <blockquote><p>“My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. Whoever says ‘I know him’ but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this we may know that we are in him: whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.”</p></blockquote>
      <h3>Washed, Yet Feet Need Washing<br><small>John 13:7–10 (ESV)</small></h3>
      <blockquote><p>Jesus answered him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.” Peter said to him, “You shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.” Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” Jesus said to him, “The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you.”</p></blockquote>
      <p>Addictions and struggles are real, and we must be diligent to guard against them. But when we come to Christ, we don’t give Him just one part of our life — we surrender everything. Our whole life belongs to Him. And when we fully surrender, even the hardest battles grow lighter, because His grace strengthens us to press on.</p>
      <p>That’s the heart of this song: repentance, surrender, and the bold declaration — no looking back.</p>
