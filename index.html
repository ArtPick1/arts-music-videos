But when we compare it with the New Testament\u2019s language, something feels off. Scripture consistently calls believers saints, children of God, and new creations \u2014 never sinners. This raises an important question: Should a Christian identify as a sinner, or has Christ given us a new identity that we must embrace?\n________________________________________\nThesis Statement\nA Christian\u2019s identity is not \u201csinner.\u201d In Christ, believers are called saints, new creations, and children of God. True repentance means turning away from sin and dying to the old self. Christians are not meant to continue sinning as a way of life (Rom. 6:1\u20132; 1 John 3:9). Yes, we stumble at times, but those stumbles do not define who we are. The truth of the gospel is this: we are saints in Christ who may occasionally stumble, not sinners who occasionally do something right.\nClarification \nThis is not a claim of perfection or sinless living. Scripture is plain: \u201cIf we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves\u201d (1 John 1:8). Christians still wrestle with temptation and must confess their sins (1 John 1:9). But imperfection does not equal identity. Sinner describes our condition before Christ; saint describes our condition after Christ.\n________________________________________\nSinner vs. Saint \u2014 Identity Traits\nSinner (Before Christ)    Saint (In Christ)\nDefined by sin (Eph. 2:1\u20133)    Defined by grace (Eph. 2:4\u20136)\nSlave to sin (Rom. 6:6, 20)    Slave to righteousness (Rom. 6:18)\nOld self/nature (Col. 3:9)    New creation (2 Cor. 5:17)\nUnder condemnation (Rom. 8:1, outside Christ)    No condemnation in Christ (Rom. 8:1)\nSeparated from God (Isa. 59:2)    Reconciled to God (Rom. 5:10)\nDead in trespasses (Eph. 2:1)    Alive in Christ (Rom. 6:11)\nEnemy of God (Rom. 5:10)    Child of God (1 John 3:1\u20132)\nHabitual practice of sin (1 John 3:8)    Called to holiness (1 Pet. 1:15\u201316)\n________________________________________\nPaul and John on Sin and Identity\nPaul\u2019s Teaching\nPaul is often cited as calling himself the \u201cchief of sinners\u201d (1 Tim. 1:15). But careful reading shows he was magnifying grace, not describing his present identity.\n\u2022 Formerly a sinner: \u201cThough formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent\u201d (1 Tim. 1:13). The Greek adverb \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (proteron) means \u201cformerly, once, in the past.\u201d It points to Paul\u2019s old life, not his current state.\n\u2022 \u201cChief of sinners\u201d clarified: In verse 15 Paul says, \u201cof whom I am (\u03b5\u1f30\u03bc\u03af, eimi) foremost.\u201d Though this is present tense, NT Greek often uses present verbs to express a category or rhetorical emphasis rather than strict time reference. Paul uses this as humble self-categorization, not as a doctrinal statement of his present identity. Verse 16 makes this explicit: Paul became an example of Christ\u2019s perfect patience, not proof that he remained a sinner.\n\u2022 New identity: Elsewhere Paul never calls Christians sinners. He addresses believers as saints (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2; Eph. 1:1). He insists they are dead to sin and alive to God (Rom. 6:11), new creations (2 Cor. 5:17), and under no condemnation (Rom. 8:1).\nJohn\u2019s Teaching\nJohn strikes a careful balance between honesty about sin and clarity about identity.\n\u2022 Acknowledges sin\u2019s reality: \u201cIf we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves\u201d (1 John 1:8). Christians still stumble, but they confess and are cleansed (1 John 1:9).\n\u2022 Not a lifestyle of sin: \u201cNo one born of God makes a practice of sinning\u201d (1 John 3:9). The Greek phrase \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03bd (poiein t\u0113n hamartian) indicates ongoing, habitual sin, not occasional failure.\n\u2022 Born sinners, reborn saints: Scripture affirms original sin \u2014 \u201cBehold, I was brought forth in iniquity\u201d (Ps. 51:5). All are born sinners (Rom. 3:23). But in Christ, believers are reborn as saints and children of God (1 John 3:1\u20132).\n________________________________________\nTimeline of Identity\nStage    Identity    Scripture\nBefore Christ    Sinner by nature \u2014 born in sin, enslaved to sin, under wrath    Ps. 51:5; Rom. 3:23; Eph. 2:1\u20133\nAt Conversion    Forgiven \u2014 washed, justified, adopted    Acts 22:16; Rom. 5:1; Gal. 4:4\u20137\nAfter Conversion    Saint / Child of God \u2014 new creation, dead to sin, alive in Christ    2 Cor. 5:17; Rom. 6:11; 1 John 3:1\u20132\n________________________________________\nTheological & Practical Implications\n1. How we speak about ourselves\nWords shape identity. To call ourselves \u201cjust sinners\u201d reinforces an identity Scripture says is dead. The New Testament never uses this label for believers but consistently calls them saints.\n2. Assurance in Christ\nIdentifying as a sinner can erode confidence and keep believers in constant doubt. Identifying as a saint honors Christ\u2019s finished work and strengthens assurance (Rom. 8:1).\n3. Motivation for holiness\nIf I believe I am a sinner, sin feels inevitable. If I believe I am a saint, holiness becomes the expectation.\n4. Humility rightly understood\nTrue humility does not deny what Christ has done. It says: \u201cI was a sinner, but Christ has made me new.\u201d Paul models this by remembering his past while boasting in Christ\u2019s grace (1 Tim. 1:15\u201316; Gal. 6:14).\n5. The danger of excuses\nMany Christians misuse \u201cI\u2019m just a sinner\u201d as a \u201cget out of jail free card\u201d for lukewarm living. But Scripture never permits this (Rom. 6:15). Grace restores us when we stumble, but it never excuses sin.\n________________________________________\nConclusion\nScripture is black-and-white: all people are born sinners, condemned under sin and separated from God. But those who repent and believe in Christ are forever changed \u2014 forgiven, washed, adopted, and made saints. Paul and John both affirm that Christians may stumble, but they are no longer defined as sinners.\nTo keep calling ourselves \u201cjust sinners\u201d is not humility. It denies the new identity Christ purchased and can become an excuse for mediocrity in holiness. The balance of Scripture is this: Christians are not perfect, but they are being perfected. They are not yet sinless, but they are no longer slaves to sin.\nFinal Statement\nWe must stop identifying as sinners who occasionally do something right.\nThe gospel declares we are saints in Christ who may occasionally stumble \u2014 but our true identity is forever rooted in Him.\n________________________________________\nAdditional Note:\nThis song \u2014 or the statement \u2014 does not mean I believe in \u201conce saved, always saved.\u201d I do believe it is possible for us to willfully fall away and become shipwrecked. But this does not happen simply when you stumble or fall, as long as you repent, turn away, and keep following Christ. One thing I once heard from a pastor at the church I used to attend is that salvation is like Tupperware \u2014 you have to try very hard to destroy it, and that\u2019s not easy. I may not have agreed with him on other things, but on that point I did agree.\n"}, {"title": "Voices in Your Head", "url": "https://youtu.be/x4U9iuwml18", "description": "This song explores the turmoil of inner voices \u2014 the lies, doubts, and accusations that battle within the soul.
